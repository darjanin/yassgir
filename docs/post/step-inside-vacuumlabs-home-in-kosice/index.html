<p>While we are natively remote, we do have <strong>offices</strong> in several cities in Central Europe. The second-largest city in Slovakia, <strong>Kosice</strong>, is the home of our development and design teams. Located on <strong>Zizkova</strong> <strong>Street</strong>, the office is within 10 minutes walking distance of the city center.&nbsp;<br><br>We launched the space in December 2018 with the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BrkseUPBAjs/">Christmas Party</a> being the perfect housewarming opportunity.</p>

<p>We support the growth of local tech and <a href="https://inside.vacuumlabs.com/design/ux-community-launches-in-kosice">design communities </a>and share our knowledge in areas we specialise in. Once in a while, we organise events such as <a href="https://inside.vacuumlabs.com/design/a-quick-chat-with-jan-losert-about-selling-ui-kits">Design Meetup</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K-aJwRZq74&amp;">HackKE Warmup </a>in our airy<strong> Community Space.&nbsp;</strong><br><br>There are two <strong>meeting rooms</strong> allocated for important calls or business meetings.</p>

<p>This is our <strong>Design Office.</strong> Our Design Team has a ton of experience from projects such as <a href="https://vacuumlabs.com/project/kiwi">Kiwi</a>, <a href="https://inside.vacuumlabs.com/design/receiving-personalised-skincare-in-the-comfort-of-your-home-or-office"></a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://vacuumlabs.com/project/dermoi" target="_blank">dermoi!</a>, <a href="https://vacuumlabs.com/project/digital-service-book">Roofus</a>, <a href="https://vacuumlabs.com/project/medical-brand">Diawin</a> or <a href="https://vacuumlabs.com/project/adalite">AdaLite</a>.</p>

<p>Located right next to the Design Office, the<strong> Front-end Office</strong> has Vacuumlabs Kosice’s first international team.<br><br>Many of our colleagues in the <strong><a href="https://inside.vacuumlabs.com/category/technology">Development</a> Office </strong>are alumni of <a href="https://www.upjs.sk/"><strong>Pavol Jozef Safarik University</strong></a>, a top-ranking university in Kosice. They work on projects such as <strong><a href="https://vacuumlabs.com//project/kiwi">Kiwi</a></strong> or StrongVault.</p>



<h2><strong>VacuumTips: What to do in Kosice</strong></h2>



<p>The city of Kosice offers loads of opportunities for quality team-building or sports activities. We picked our favourites:<br><br><strong>Escape Rooms </strong>or <strong>Laser Arena</strong> are perfect for relief after a day at work.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://inside.vacuumlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSC_0570-1185x791.jpg" alt="Teambuilding" class="wp-image-815"/></figure>



<p><strong>Hostinec </strong>is our best tip for informal meetings that we call <strong>VacuumBeer.&nbsp;</strong><br>Fans of sports activities also like the location of our office. For ice sports enthusiasts, there is <strong>SteelArena</strong> just next to the office. In addition, within 5 minutes of walking distance, there is the<strong> T2 Bouldering Arena</strong> and<strong> Family Gym Cassovar. </strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://vacuumlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/action-athlete-blue-863988-1055x791.jpg" alt="Flexible hours" class="wp-image-816"/></figure>



<p>With the option to work <strong>flexible hours</strong> and <strong>have a </strong><a href="https://multi-sport.sk/en/"><strong>Multisport card</strong> </a>, you can tailor your working schedule according to your needs. You can go, for example, for an afternoon swim when there are fewer people around or hit the gym at the off-peak times. In other words, the whole time-management of work is completely up to you.</p>
