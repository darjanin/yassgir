<p><strong>Banking-as-a-service solutions</strong> have been on the market for a while now &#8211; acting as much needed intermediaries between banks and fintech companies. They are playing an <strong>important role in the</strong> <strong>digital transformation of banks</strong>,&nbsp; initiating beneficiary partnerships between the players. In addition, through this end-to-end process, banks are shifting towards a more modular way of working in order to embrace third-party collaborations, while fintechs are able to execute financial service capabilities without the need of developing expensive services themselves.</p>



<h2><strong>SaaS</strong></h2>

<h2><strong>BaaS integration as a boost</strong></h2>



<p><strong>BaaS platforms enable fintechs to connect with banks’ systems via APIs</strong>, allowing them to offer branded banking solutions directly to their customers. It is a win-win-win situation. It <strong>helps the bank to build partnerships, provides a secure service to the customer, and last but not least, allows the fintech company to build revolutionary solutions as fast as possible.</strong> In other words, the bank is responsible for risk management and compliance with regulations while the fintech company can focus on the user experience and agile development.</p>
