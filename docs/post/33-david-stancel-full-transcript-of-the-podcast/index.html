        <strong>Helene Panzarino: </strong>[00:00:00] Welcome to another episode
        of banking on air with Vacuumlabs I&#8217;m Helene Panzarino. And today
        I&#8217;m joined yet again by David Stencel You might remember, or
        regular subscribers that we&#8217;ve started a cryptocurrency series,
        and we&#8217;re now in episode two. So the first one was really all
        about Bitcoin. You can go back and listen to that when you can subscribe
        and listen, the second one, we&#8217;re going to be looking at Ethereum.
        But also at smart contracts. So welcome David. David, for the people
        that haven&#8217;t listened to the first one, do you want to give a
        little introduction of yourself?
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>David Stancel: </strong>[00:00:34] Oh yeah, sure. Hello
        everyone. Glad to be here again. I&#8217;ve been researching
        cryptocurrencies for over eight years now. Along the way I did some
        projects, so different kinds of projects like NGOs, as a medication
        activities, lot of advisory activities, some NFT startups and so on and
        so on. And currently I also teach at the university, this beautiful
        topic of cryptocurrencies and also as CTO at Fumbi which is a
        cryptocurrency trading platform.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Helene Panzarino: </strong>[00:01:07] Well, I think we
        definitely came to the right guest then to explore this topic. And so
        I&#8217;ll also ask you to bear with us because there&#8217;s laypeople,
        which some of us will be some of the terminology, the vocabulary will be
        unfamiliar. So we&#8217;re going to try and unpack that because I think
        this is one of those things, of course in the news recently. We&#8217;ve
        all been watching what&#8217;s happening with Bitcoin. We&#8217;ve all
        been talking about central bank, digital currencies. We&#8217;ve all
        been trying to wrap our heads around what&#8217;s going on. But
        it&#8217;s , isn&#8217;t it? When you&#8217;re on the outside, so
        you&#8217;re on the inside. You can help us understand more. So I
        remember in around 2014-15   people started to talk about smart
        contracts and lawyers starting to shake thinking, oh, we&#8217;re not
        going to be here anymore. The same way that AI was going to take
        everybody&#8217;s jobs in banking and finance. So what is a smart
        contract really?
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>David Stancel: </strong>[00:01:59] That&#8217;s a tough question
        because actually smart contracts are more similar to actual applications
        and programs then to the regular kind of contracts. Smart contracts are
        basically ordinary. They are not so smart actually, they are pretty dump
        usually.  It just  application like a piece of code of software that is
        being run on a decentralized network. So that&#8217;s basically the one
        single major difference between  any kind of regular application that is
        run on a single server architecture and smart contracts that run on
        blockchain networks, such as typically Ethereum or others, where they
        are being simultaneously run on thousands of computers that are in the
        network. And of course this network has some peculiar functionalities
        and traits because it&#8217;s open, it&#8217;s a very decentralized,
        anybody can join the network and participate in the network by running
        these applications, which of course brings some challenges when it comes
        to building and deployment of such applications.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Helene Panzarino: </strong>[00:03:09] David, can I ask you, you
        said it&#8217;s an application, which is interesting and also we could
        have gone down a whole bunch of jokes about smart lawyers, dumb lawyers.
        We will do that she says. Does it do something, does it trigger
        something by being embedded or part of that network?
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>David Stancel: </strong>[00:03:26] I mean it does whatever we
        embed into it,  whatever we program into it. Actually, even the co
        creator of Ethereum Vitalik Buterin, he was a retrospectively found out
        that we recognize that the term smart contract was not the best choice
        for this. Because as I said, there are these kind of programs that are
        like regular kind of piece of software. But the more convenient term for
        it would be persistent scripts because given the architecture, they are
        deployed on this decentralized architecture, which is very censorship
        resistant. One of the traits of these application is that once they are
        deployed on the network, it&#8217;s really hard or almost impossible to
        remove those applications to stop them, to tamper with the code and 
        that&#8217;s probably why we are here and why we are talking about
        cryptocurrencies and blockchain space because this kind of unique trait
        that has not been present in our role. Before the invention  of
        blockchain.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Helene Panzarino: </strong>[00:04:31] Okay, now I understand
        better and I see what you&#8217;re saying because I think you&#8217;re
        right. The term is slightly misleading and that probably confuses
        people. Now we&#8217;ve talked about what they are and from a piece of
        part of the tech of it, how do we actually use them currently? And that
        might be in financial services, but that might be somewhere else. So
        just maybe a couple of examples of how we use it.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>David Stancel: </strong>[00:04:52] Yeah probably anybody who has
        been following the blockchain space could hear probably a thousand times
        like how all kinds of application and usage cases for blockchain and for
        smart contracts, since it&#8217;s basically a piece of software. So it
        can do pretty much anything you programming suits. So it can be used in
        multiple ways. But still it&#8217;s true even today that the most of the
        use cases, whether it&#8217;s for blockchain, but also for smart
        contracts, it&#8217;s in the financial space what we called  DeFi
        decentralized  finance. We&#8217;ll  talking about probably next time.
        Most of the things happen currently today when it comes to smart
        contracts. So we have lots of basically applications, pieces of code
        that behave like financial institutions, even though they are not,
        they&#8217;re just really like a simple piece of code or set of smart
        contracts that are compost together and interact with each other. They
        perform functionalities such as exchanges, lending platforms or they
        allow us to create the synthetic derivatives on top of the blockchain
        networks and our insurance products and  all kinds of things. Of course,
        apart from these financial use cases, there is lots of things going on
        in the area of logistics and healthcare industry as well. Basically
        these smart contracts could allow us to, of course automate lot of
        processes in all of these areas, but through is most of the attention is
        still being paid to the financial use cases.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Helene Panzarino: </strong>[00:06:21] And could one of the ones
        that send, for example, you mentioned  shipping or in other areas, is
        that something like, could smart contracts be used in trade finance in
        that regard?
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>David Stancel: </strong>[00:06:30] Yeah, definitely trade
        finance is definitely one of the areas where it&#8217;s been explored
        and being used. What it boils down to is always that traditionally,
        oftentimes it was the case in the corporate environment, enterprise
        environment, when it comes to blockchain, there was always this kind of
        dilemma of whether to use a permissionless open public blockchain
        networks or the so-called private blockchain networks that are set up
        only between some of the entities involved in those business processes
        or consortias.  Typically this way, if you have more permissioned
        environment, the blockchain kind of a little bit is losing the edge
        compared to regular enterprise legacy solutions and databases. It can be
        done there, but because it usually has been deployed in this way and we
        couldn&#8217;t see so much network effect and adoption coming in there.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Helene Panzarino: </strong>[00:07:25] And I can appreciate the
        permissioned blockchains or almost like databases, to be honest, in some
        ways aren&#8217;t there. There&#8217;s always be confined it or safer. I
        think there was always also that discussion, whether it&#8217;s true or
        not about the amount of energy involved in mining and rogue miners and
        how they could have control and if you&#8217;re in financial services,
        then we don&#8217;t need that. We need some other form of control and
        that say permissioned blockchains or wannabes people in this space are
        having problems with some of the regulators and other areas as well. So
        it&#8217;s not been a smooth ride really for anybody. I think in that
        space, either. You mentioned Ethereum early on and again, in episode
        one, we talked about the actual Bitcoin cause it was, oh, you know,
        it&#8217;s all the rage as it were. So what is Ethereum and how is it
        different to Bitcoin?
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>David Stancel: </strong>[00:08:14] Okay.  Ethereum was created
        by probably now, already quite famous person, founder of Ethereum
        Vitalik Buterin, who was back then a young boy who was a journalist a
        Bitcoin magazine.  He was a college dropout who started to work on
        Ethereum because he basically took the concept of Bitcoin and I was
        like, okay, we have a really cool decentralized network that we use for
        sending and receiving transactions and moving the store, like some value
        over the internet naturally, but we could extend this concept and enrich
        it with some other functionalities, not just to do kind of simple
        transactions, but basically we could try to upload any kind of programs
        and applications. He conceived the concept of this blockchain network
        that would have on top of it, the ritual of Turing complete virtual
        machine, which will be capable to compute anything at the big program,
        into it, given enough competition of power.  That&#8217;s what he did.
        He wasn&#8217;t actually the first one to do so. There were some
        attempts before Ethereum was conceived, but they kind of failed. And
        Ethereum was probably, definitely the only one at that point around
        2014, when it was introduced caught up and got lots of attention from
        the community. And lots of people started to work on it and then in
        2015, the Ethereum network launched and allowed us to do this smart
        contract applications to create assets on top of Ethereum, which was not
        so easy to do on top of Bitcoin. Even though if we would probably talk
        to Bitcoin maximalists, they would argue that you can do all these
        things out on top of Bitcoin, but it&#8217;s more complicated. And for
        some reason it doesn&#8217;t happen there so much. At least in this era,
        this Ethereum stole the show for the Bitcoin and now us, that&#8217;s
        why a lot of people think that there is discussion about possible
        flipping, which means that Ethereum would flip Bitcoin in terms of the
        market cap value. Because it can actually capture the whole lot more
        value because there&#8217;s so much more activity on top of the Ethereum
        which is actually true. Many people don&#8217;t know that, but for the
        last few months, that&#8217;s has been the truth that Ethereum has been
        settling much larger volumes, transaction volumes, there has been much
        more going on  on the network. Because it can be used for so many use
        cases. So, and it has also become infamously victim  of its own success
        because the network is congested and they are very high fees currently
        on the network, which are being solved throu any other solutions. But
        this is how Ethereum is different to Bitcoin and of course now in 2021,
        we have also a lot of, a lot of competitors to Ethereum that are trying
        to enter the arena of smart contracts. And they&#8217;re coming up with
        different innovations and different design trade-offs for the smart
        contract networks.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Helene Panzarino: </strong>[00:11:15] You mentioned assets and
        uses or use cases in the Ethereum. So could you have a couple of
        examples of what assets might be created or what a couple of these use
        cases might be?
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>David Stancel: </strong>[00:11:25] Probably people who have been
        following the blockchain space, they remember the term ICO and this ICO
        craze that we had, the 2017.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Helene Panzarino: </strong>[00:11:35] It seems like a long time
        ago.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>David Stancel: </strong>[00:11:39] Yeah, definitely. We had lots
        of, lots of projects that are trying to integrate blockchain to their
        applications. And usually what it meant was that they can kind of create
        a token that had some artificially created the functionality and role.
        It was just like a concept of before we called it credits or something
        like that, it depends on the applications, but now they were not on the
        SQL database, but they were on a decentralized blockchain network and
        they were more liquid . People and users could trade with them and
        that&#8217;s exactly what fueled the hype around it. And we could
        wittness all very broad spectrum of assets being created there. And 
        awesome when we look at today and all this defy space, we have these
        different decentralized, smart contract applications that are performing
        these financial activities. And because there are still some decisions
        that needs to be made from the perspective of the applications. So how
        do we do it? We have token holders. That have these token and have
        governance rise so they can vote on the changes onto protocols. And
        oftentimes these tokens come with different sets of rights or different
        sets of benefits. Sometimes they can even get some portion of the reward
        or of the profit generated by those protocols and so on.  It can be 
        different, but this is roughly  that like  what&#8217;s going on there.
        And we are now all these crypto assets that  are in from technological
        point of view they are pretty similar because they are just so cold ERC
        20 tokens ,  but they have always different function in their own
        ecosystem.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Helene Panzarino: </strong>[00:13:25] It&#8217;s interesting,
        cause it seems like 2017 is almost, we would call it ancient history
        book. Do you remember the craze and the whole FOMO around it, that fear
        of missing out and closed,  token within a closed environment or  if you
        had a telco involved and a bunch of retailers and  you could spend get
        tokens and spend them within that closed environment and then go out to
        market and raise money initially for marketing and then for more. And it
        almost seems like that came and it went. And we forgot about those. You
        said the ICO was all the rage, right. And then we, that we haven&#8217;t
        spoken about it anymore. Now we&#8217;re speaking more about the
        different, as you said, the Ethereum and the competitors. So is it
        becoming now a very competitive environment or they&#8217;re, you know,
        5, 10, 20, a hundred competitors to Ethereum?
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>David Stancel: </strong>[00:14:13] Ethereum historically has
        always had much more competitors than Bitcoin, because I think Bitcoin
        has a unique place in the cryptocurrency world that cannot be replicated
        so easily, but with Ethereum it&#8217;s not that easy or  it&#8217;s
        more complicated. The reason is that also lots of smart contract
        platforms that are coming to the market. They are for example,
        oftentimes replicate the Ethereum virtual machine. So if that person
        wants to develop on these new platforms, they can still use the same
        smart contract, the same language solidity, and that is used on Ethereum
        so it&#8217;s kind of easy for them to transfer. Of course, these new
        networks, there are quite many of them. I think today we can say that
        they are at least reasonable, like 10 reasonable competitors when it
        comes to the smart contract platforms.  All of them. Let&#8217;s say
        this 10 or 15, maybe even they come with different technologies. Some of
        them are pretty innovative. They do offer different trade-offs. They are
        typically more scalable than Ethereum but again, at some costs and
        that&#8217;s a more nuanced and deeper debate that we probably not going
        to have today, but there&#8217;s definitely a lot of competitors,
        especially this last year. We could see probably at least sounded like a
        seven, eight major smart contract platform being launched.  It&#8217;s
        still, we can say it&#8217;s in the beginning like all this platform
        just are now trying to bootstrap some communities and the show off.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Helene Panzarino: </strong>[00:15:52] And is that this is maybe
        a naive question for someone, as I said, who&#8217;s more lay person in
        this space. Is there an interoperability between these different
        competitors? And actually what&#8217;s the interoperability when it
        comes to FIA for example, with crypto as well. Does that exist?
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>David Stancel: </strong>[00:16:10] I mean, so the intro
        interoperable.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Helene Panzarino: </strong>[00:16:16] Funny word, isn&#8217;t
        it?
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>David Stancel: </strong>[00:16:18] Yeah. That&#8217;s tough one.
        So this phenomenon is usually provided by exchanges or brokerage
        companies typically. So that&#8217;s how we usually people transfer
        their fee and money into the smart contract platforms and the
        interoperability between the smart contract platforms themselves
        it&#8217;s a little bit more trickier. There&#8217;s no simple answer to
        that, but we do have definitely multiple ways how different smart
        contract platforms can communicate between each other. Oftentimes there
        are some ways that are more centralized and we have to kind of more rely
        on the third parties that we need to trust. And also, especially
        recently in the past few months, we could see on the markets and some of
        the  first solutions that are trying to completely mitigate these need
        to trust the third party in this way. So some so-called bridges that
        connect these platforms and that provide sort of trustless way how to
        transfer assets between those platforms. So, but it&#8217;s still,
        again, very early for the space. It&#8217;s very likely that I think in
        a matter of two years, let&#8217;s say all this measure platforms will
        be interconnected. Or this one, because we can say that usually Ethereum
        is connected probably to every single major competitor. But all of those
        other networks are not connected between themselves. So Ethereum was
        definitely  I would say trading venue of the new internet.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Helene Panzarino: </strong>[00:17:55] It&#8217;s really
        fascinating, actually. And as you were talking, I was also thinking
        about everything that&#8217;s happened over like the last year and a
        half. And every time we talk about a cryptocurrency, we think about
        people that are outside the mainstream system. I mean, now we&#8217;re
        splitting it. We&#8217;re talking about central bank, digital
        currencies, as well as sitting alongside FIA .But also I sometimes
        think, industries run away with what the customer or the consumer wants.
        Are these solutions really beneficial to the consumer and the end user
        and possibly let&#8217;s do a little bit closer down on the unbanked or
        the under-banked people outside of the mainstream system, or is that
        just something that the industry is, we just talk about those marketing
        hype?.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>David Stancel: </strong>[00:18:34] All of these things 
        we&#8217;re created in a way in there designed in a way so they are
        completely permissionless and accessible, ideally to everybody on the
        planet who has connections with the internet. But especially recently as
        the network got really popular and it got congested, the feasts Chiraq
        that it basically  eliminated All the regular mainstream retail users.
        And it has been the main trading venue for the speculators, market
        makers and very people who trade a lot. But I think looking forward the
        outlook is that definitely this, all this Netflix will be much, much
        more easier to use for regular people. I think kind of by accident what
        Ethereum happened to achieve is that I think they&#8217;re kind of
        almost solved this one of the kind of questions are on the open
        internet, the single sign on because  now, if you have extensions to
        your browser, such as Metta mask, which is probably one of the most used
        and most popular pieces of infrastructure when it comes to the Ethereum
        and the smart contract world, you can basically log in with this through
        mathematic , through  your Ethereum account to multiple services. They
        don&#8217;t need to even know your other identity because they just know
        your address and, since we are on the blockchain, all your past actions
        are being locked and recorded and are there out to be seen by everyone.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Helene Panzarino: </strong>[00:20:08] Everyone on the
        blockchain. This raises a really important points about the anonymity,
        but also having enough information about somebody we&#8217;re talking
        about that clearly in terms of digital identity after what happened
        around the world and in terms of COVID. You don&#8217;t need to know
        everything about me for me to walk into a bar and buy a drink, with my,
        Token or anything else that I&#8217;m using. You just need to know that
        I have the right. I have the permission to be able to do that. You
        don&#8217;t need to know my medical history, my address, my telephone
        number, my age, my, you know, all the other things about me. As long as
        the token says that I&#8217;m, I am where I&#8217;m supposed to be, or
        I&#8217;m allowed to be. And I think this opens up the discussion.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>David Stancel: </strong>[00:20:49] Yeah. I think if you were
        showing me your Ethereum address I can say what kind of person you are.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Helene Panzarino: </strong>[00:20:57] Somebody who&#8217;s,
        well, probably more technically adept than I am. I have no Ethereum on
        that dress, right. I&#8217;m heavily into the trading. I mean, for me,
        this is fascinating. I was two weeks ago? I can&#8217;t remember one and
        a half ago I was on a panel and Vitalik the was the keynote that kicked
        off the panel in the middle east. So I think we also, the rest of the
        other parts of the world now are starting to look at this also as
        Africa, I mean the whole middle asian region middle east and north
        Africa is now taking notice. Whereas before it might&#8217;ve been
        something that we just looked at in our own little bubble, which is why
        I think also my head, I was thinking, you know, how does this help with
        parts of the world where we have a lot of remittance happening, or we
        have a lot of people that are coming in and working from abroad .Where
        we have a lot of people who are un-banked and under-banked, but have
        access to smartphones. Where we&#8217;re not, you know, some have very
        deep internet penetration, others don&#8217;t. And so they&#8217;re just
        onnot smart phones with dumb phones or the phones that aren&#8217;t
        accessing.  But it&#8217;s definitely something that&#8217;s capturing,
        people&#8217;s imagination more on a global basis. I have no doubt that
        we&#8217;ll be revisiting the subject. I know we&#8217;re coming up,
        actually, everybody on episode three of this series. We are going to
        look at decentralized finance and NFTs. Oh, I could talk for years about
        NFTs and whether or not they&#8217;re actually going to stick around or
        not, or is it just a fad? So, David, I feel more knowledgeable now than
        I did when we started, which is great. And I felt the same way
        we&#8217;ve finished the Bitcoin session. So I thank you for that. And I
        would say to everybody, if you&#8217;re subscribing or you&#8217;re
        joining us for the first time, go back and listen to the first episode
        and stay with us for the third episode. As I said, where we get to DeFi
        and NFTs. Thank you very much for being with us on Banking on air and
        everyone please for all the usual channels to subscribe and join us
        again. Thoroughly enjoyable.
      </p>

        <strong>David Stancel: </strong>[00:22:53] Thanks for having me. It was
        a pleasure.
