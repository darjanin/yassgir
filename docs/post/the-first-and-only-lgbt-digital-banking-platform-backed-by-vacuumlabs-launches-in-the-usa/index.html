<p>Today is an important day for the LGBT + community. November 18th, 2020 marks the launch of Daylight, our latest portfolio venture that we’ve been working on the last year. One of the co-founders of Vacuumlabs, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ftacnik/">Matej Ftacnik</a>, is a long term supporter of the LGBT+ community in Slovakia and has been leading the effort to build a new venture in this space for quite some time</p>



<p>As part of our venture-building initiatives, he came up with the idea of a bank that tackles the inherent problems of the LGBT+ community and in early 2020, he brought in the founding team <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mr-rob-curtis/">Rob Curtis</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/billiesimmons/">Billie Simmons</a> – which has greatly contributed to the business ever since. After a period of intensive support and hands-on collaboration with Matej and the Vacuumlabs venture team, the Daylight team has received the necessary initial funding and technology resources to drive Daylight forward on its own.</p>



<p>Matej continues to be involved as the Chairman of the Board for Daylight. Rob Curtis has said: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“What we love about Matej is that it took a Slovak activist to take a chance on building a company that would have such an impact on the LGBT+ community in the USA. Ultimately, without him, whatever impact we achieve as a business wouldn’t be possible. And we are excited to work with him on the Board.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Vacuumlabs acts as the technology partner that is powering the development of Daylight&#8217;s digital banking platform alongside Visa and Marqeta. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Combining the power of Vacuumlabs’ world-class fintech engineering talent and our knowledge of the LGBT+ community in the US makes this the ideal partnership to build a major bank of affinity that helps LGBT+ people prepare for the future faster,” says Billie Simmons.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
