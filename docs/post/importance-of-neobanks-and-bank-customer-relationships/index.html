<p>Being a black American in the US and experiencing how underserved this community is, not only from an education or employment point of view but also from a financial one, was for <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/donald-j-hawkins/">Donald Hawkins</a> a starting gear for filling the gap in the market.</p>



<p>He could see how the community lacked financial literacy; they didn’t understand how wealth building and money itself worked. Donald decided to make a change. To do this, he established the first neobank for black Americans, Boulevard, to meet the needs of the community. And this was an inherently inclusive initiative; every community is welcome to use Boulevard’s services, regardless of race or color.</p>



<p>In the 2nd episode of Banking on Air with Helene Panzarino, Donald Hawkins talks not only about systematic oppression of black Americans: he talks about the necessity of community banks and importance of the relationship between banks and customers. With the world changing, particularly due to the impact of COVID-19, everything is happening virtually.</p>



<p>In fact, it’s fair to say that traditional banking isn’t possible anymore. In the past, banks were more transactional than relationship-oriented; but a saturated market requires more than good features. Banks need to keep up with generation Z to be able to survive and not be eaten by their competitors.</p>



<p>Easier to be said than done?</p>
