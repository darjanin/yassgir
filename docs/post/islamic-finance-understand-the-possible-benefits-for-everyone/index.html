<p>Does Islamic finance seem a concept that’s totally foreign to you, something you’d solely associate with the Middle East? You may be surprised to find out what a significant and growing global force this now, is and how fintech organizations can benefit.<br><br>In the Islamic world, institutions operate in accordance with the guiding principles of Islam – both what the religion allows: <em>halal,</em> and what it prohibits: <em>haram.</em> – Banking is certainly no exception.</p>



<p>Islamic finance follows the principles of<strong> Sharia law</strong>. This means in practice that interest payments are not a feature of the banking system, as Islamic law forbids Muslim people to either receive or pay interest. Likewise, certain sectors are strictly avoided for investment such as tobacco, alcohol or gambling.</p>



<h2>So how do Islamic banks provide help for home buyers? </h2>



<p>A very popular type of Islamic ‘mortgage’ is Ijarah or ‘lease to own’. The bank purchases the property outright and the person who wants to eventually secure full ownership of the property pays both regular ‘rent’ to the bank for use of the property and also repays the purchase price in installments. Once the principal has been repaid in full, ownership is transferred.</p>



<p>As Syed Musheer Ahmed, Founder &amp; MD of Finstep Asia explained, </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Ownership of the asset is transferred to the holder, and the asset is leased back to the insurer; the person is charged rent to use of that asset during the time period of the bond.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Likewise, other financial systems have bonds which are, of course, interest-bearing instruments; yet ‘interest’ can never feature in a Sharia-compliant financial product. Instead, a sukuk is popularly used to generate regular income streams for investors. This is an Islamic financial certificate with some similarity to a bond. Through a sukuk investors hold a direct share in a specific tangible asset, and on the back of this are entitled to a share of the earnings that asset generates.</p>



<h2>Specific services for specific community</h2>



<p>These are clearly very different financial products to those seen from other types of banks. One exciting aspect is that even though these Sharia-compliant instruments have been especially developed for Muslims, they are by no means the only ones who could benefit here:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> “These products clearly grew out of a religious context, but they could definitely be of strong interest to those of other faiths too.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Another key factor is that close to two billion Muslims now live all across the world and it is imperative to provide them with financial services in accordance with Islam. This presents a significant market opportunity for fintechs everywhere. According to Musheer, there’s a vast and ever widening education gap to be plugged and huge global opportunities for taking Islamic banking digital.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Senior management in banking needs to think about how to deliver new business services because it’s now a matter of survival. If these banks aren’t able to update their processes and their digital offerings are not sufficiently compelling, they will face existential threats. It’s up to key consultants like Vacuumlabs to tell them about the major opportunities they are potentially missing out on. Digital transformation is key. There is a huge need for outreach in the form of education.”</p></blockquote>
