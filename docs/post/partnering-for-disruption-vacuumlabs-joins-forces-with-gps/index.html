<p><strong>We are happy to announce a new partnership with GPS, one of the companies that is practically invisible to the end customer – and yet, is a key component of the fintech ecosystem. </strong>GPS (Global Processing Services) is the Visa-backed, award-winning payments processing partner powering many of today’s most high-profile fintech innovators and disruptors, including Revolut and Starling Bank.</p>



<p>GPS is often referred to as fintech&#8217;s best kept secret – it allows consumer-facing companies to provide fast payments as a card processing backbone. When you pay via Revolut, for example, you don&#8217;t even realise how complicated the process behind the payment is and the technological innovations that have taken place to make this work.</p>



<p>Thanks to GPS’s services, these consumer-facing companies do not have to develop card processing from scratch, and can focus fully on providing the best user experience possible or on creating services tailored to specific customer groups. To bring fintech innovation within reach of new market entrants and ensure it is more efficient for experienced players, GPS challenges every detail of its operations and customer support, extending its effectiveness in breaking down barriers to fintech innovation.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“<em>GPS is one of the most prestigious and well-established global payment solutions. At Vacuumlabs, we’re excited to have the opportunity to support an industry leader and continue on our mutual mission of building an ecosystem that drives innovation and digital transformation amongst fintechs, digital banks, and e-wallet providers,</em>” said Tom Clementson, Group Head of Fintech at Vacuumlabs.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>Samuel Hapák, Chief Executive Officer at Vacuumlabs added: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“<em>We’re excited to partner with GPS, one of the leading global payments providers, and we look forward to helping them build&nbsp; world-class products for their customers around the world.</em>”</p></blockquote>



<p>Joanne Dewar, Chief Executive Officer at GPS, commented: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>“Vacuumlabs have a proven history of working with leading fintechs, so it is a natural fit to be partnering with them, especially with our combined interests in enabling innovative solutions. Vacuumlabs is a trusted development partner which will allow GPS to increase our existing technical capabilities and further advance our mission of enabling financial empowerment for everyone.”</em></p></blockquote>



<p>Vacuumlabs has a long track record in supporting the development of brands and companies that accelerate change in the world of financial services, which is evident in its recent roster of successes. These include being the first company ever to implement Thought Machine in Asia, building a next-generation digital bank, developing the 2030 Carbon Offset Calculator for Doconomy, and innovating for inclusion building Daylight, the very first LGBT+ digital banking platform in the USA.</p>



<p>Despite COVID-19’s impact on the market, Vacuumlabs has delivered consistent growth in 2020 and forged several strategic partnerships to support the next generation of fintechs in order to rebuild the global economy.</p>
