<p>Digital banking is now an integral part of our everyday lives. We’re happy using internet banking to pay our bills or request a loan. Likewise, apps to check our account balance, withdraw cash from the ATM or to order a new credit card. But what’s the real purpose behind digital banking? According to Colin Payne, VP of Capgemini Invent, for this we need to drill down to underlying customer motivations and seek out their core priorities:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Banking is not a subject area, which fills people with inspired thinking and makes them want to switch on their phone and access their bank account immediately. People want banking that’s transparent and simple. They want it to be really invisible, because honestly, who of us really want to engage with banking products? Getting a mortgage is not about mortgage products but about buying a home. It’s a major life experience.” &#8211; Colin Payne</p></blockquote>



<p>This is something Colin calls ‘<strong>inventive banking</strong>’ – being there for the customer with the right product at the right time, harnessing technology to deliver seamless, painless services. And, to move towards inventive banking, banks need to use data. To truly engage with clients and make a difference, a bank needs to know its customer base and tap into the granularity of customer data to understand their habits and priorities.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“The right trajectory for banks is to serve individual customer needs. We have to know who they are and then we can start talking to them about what they need. And once you’ve identified the need, just serve it.” &#8211; Colin Payne</p></blockquote>



<p><strong>The key is to strengthen relationships:</strong></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“To serve your tribe or community through using data, you can surprise the person on the upside through providing just what they had in mind. If you can have a relationship with someone who identifies in a certain way and you can likewise subtly channel that sense of community and bring that on board, you can have a conversation which engages in a much more direct, understandable way. This is <strong>humanizing banking</strong>.” &#8211; Colin Payne</p></blockquote>
