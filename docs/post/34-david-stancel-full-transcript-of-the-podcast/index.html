<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: </strong>[00:00:00] Welcome this next episode of Banking on air Vacuumlabs, podcast. I&#8217;m Helene Panzarino and I&#8217;m your host and we are continuing our series on all things to do with Bitcoin blockchain. And today it&#8217;s decentralized finance and NFTs at for this series as usual I am not alone. I&#8217;m joined once again by David Stencel .David welcome back and for those of who miss, who somehow missed episodes one and two of our series, should we give them a little bit of a background on you?</p>



<p><strong>David Stancel: </strong>[00:00:34] Sure. Hello, everyone. Happy to be here again. As I mentioned already, before I&#8217;ve been researching cryptocurrencies for quite some time. Now I&#8217;ve been advising a lot of companies and startups and projects that have been working in the cryptocurrency area. And I&#8217;ve been also teaching at the university, this beautiful subject of cryptocurrencies and the blockchain and in my free time I also&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; work on a book that is concerned with the history and the evolution of cryptocurrencies as well.</p>



<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: </strong>[00:01:04] I feel your pain there, David&nbsp; the book writing thing is, you know, a couple of them in there. Listen. So I said, thank you for joining us.&nbsp; I said from the beginning of this, that we&#8217;re carrying on with our theme and this time we&#8217;re getting into something where&nbsp; DeFi , decentralized finance and NFTs, which we kind of alluded to a little bit in episode one and I thought might be a fad. So as we dig into this deeper, we can talk more about what this is and why is it still with us and will it stay? So last time we spoke a lot about theory and how it was different from blockchain and we&#8217;re getting into a lot of the unstructured during of these discussions and descriptions and definitions. Decentralized finance, what is decentralized finance?</p>



<p><strong>David Stancel: </strong>[00:01:53] I think decentralized finance is one of the most exciting&nbsp;&nbsp; use case of&nbsp; the whole blockchain world. As the name suggests it is a parallel financial universe that consists of&nbsp; decentralized, smart contract based applications that perform functionalities that we are usually accustomed to see in financial institutions, banks, exchanges,&nbsp; hedge funds and so on. But these functionalities are performed in DeFi by these pieces of code that are uploaded on some of the blockchain networks, such as Ethereum and because they are uploaded there in a distributed network, they are basically unstoppable oftentimes. They are impossible to temporary. And they are fully automated and together they create a beautiful, very exciting universe of&nbsp; applications and actually also products that we haven&#8217;t had here before.</p>



<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: </strong>[00:02:59] And again, as I&#8217;m listening to you, I&#8217;m thinking of, for those of you who miss&nbsp; the previous episode, go back on there and have a listen to what we talked about. Smart contracts being probably misnamed and I think you mentioned that Itali, as she said, that probably was a poor name for what they are, because you just said again, their applications, right? I did not realize though that we were going into a parallel universe, I have to be completely honest. Okay. So this is good. This is good. Now you mentioned that there are products and their services and that it&#8217;s happening in parallel to what we&#8217;d normally be doing in financial services. So what&#8217;s some, a couple of examples of products and services, and which are the most popular that would be part of that other world?</p>



<p><strong>David Stancel: </strong>[00:03:41] Because as every financial system at the beginning, we need to create lots of kind of financial primitives that are the core of the whole system and upon which other applications can be built. And therefore&nbsp; some of the first use cases we could see in this area of DeFi&nbsp; were always some exchanges. These exchanges usually functioned a little bit differently to the regular exchanges that most of the traders are used to so-called in an order book based exchanges. What was one of the greatest innovations so far in DeFi was the invention of the concept of&nbsp; AMM&#8217;s automated market makers, which probably one of the first exchanges of this kind was Uniswap, which is kind of a multi-billion project that was initially founded by a single guy with a grant of $60,000. And this was probably like three years ago.&nbsp; Now this decentralized exchange has the volumes of like 10 billion a month or something. And it&#8217;s probably the major trading venue for everybody in DeFi. And maybe to clarify, how is this different and what kind of advantages it offers to traders, is that in a typical order book based exchanges, you always need to have two parties. Someone who wants to sell somebody who wants to buy, whereas in the AMM&#8217;s all this is basically performed by the smart contract. So you don&#8217;t need to find the second party that you trade with, but this smart contract always gives you a quote&nbsp; on the trade you want to make. So the main point is that it makes also all kinds of assets, a much more liquid than it would usually be. And&nbsp; that&#8217;s&nbsp; why , it was kind of easy to bootstrap in the DeFi space because there are so many tokens and they had very little liquidity and thru this automated smart contracts, they became more liquid and more easily tradable and of course, that was a very desirable from the perspective of the teams developing these applications. So this decentralized exchanges is definitely the first product to move forward&nbsp; some of the other very important product and protocols in the space include the lending protocols. These are protocols that basically allow you to borrow some assets. You are still talking about crypto, so there are no fee and money involved. It&#8217;s always about the crypto assets, different kinds of crypto assets. Some of them might be stable coins, but some other assets, of course, including stuff like Ethereum&nbsp; all kinds of DeFi tokens, which we can explore later on. So these are the protocols where again, we don&#8217;t necessarily have the&nbsp; counterparty during the lending, but we have a smart contract that performs these. Smart contracts that can hold onto collateral. And against this smart contract, people can borrow and land assets. So these are one of the most popular applications in DeFi so far.&nbsp; Then we have a bunch of others, like a different derivatives platforms that allow us to create some synthetic assets. Recently, there was a lots of hype about these protocols because basically they allow some people like profit traders, let&#8217;s say this point, to trade really like stocks, but on the blockchain, which are synthetic stock so they are not legacy regulated stocks that we know from the legacy financial road. But these are just tokens that have synthetically created and they are value expected to the real world counterparts to the stocks of those companies. But the difference is of course it, because they are the blockchain world that different rules apply. You might not need to be KYC, it not provide your identity and stuff like that. There might not be some limitations or restrictions that are in place in the regular trading venues.</p>



<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: </strong>[00:07:50] David, I&#8217;m listening to you and I&#8217;m thinking, okay, I get it. I can listen to you how the soul runs in a parallel world. Also derivatives in the real world are complicated enough, but taking them somewhere else is interesting. For me as the kind of woman on the street type thing the person that&#8217;s not into the technology side of it, why would I do this? What would I get involved in this instead of doing it in the other world, in the traditional financial world?</p>



<p><strong>David Stancel: </strong>[00:08:15] Why would you do it? So the truth is that probably something like 1,5 billion people in the world don&#8217;t have access even to the bank account, not to mention the access to the capital markets and the financial markets in general. So of course, all these DeFi systems and protocols are all permissionless. So that&#8217;s definitely one of the greatest advantage that could be accessed by anyone. Of course, in reality there are still more kind of play for speculators and traders that can afford, to lose lots of money. As we&nbsp; also mentioned in the previous episode, the Ethereum network has been congested a lot and the transaction fees care rocketed in the height of this fees made it kind of unfeasible for any non-bank people to interact with these protocols as of now. But of course the scalability is a big topic in the crypto space and there are many, many affords and initiatives to solve this problems and we can expect, I think, quite reasonably that in a matter of a one, two years, I think it can be again a much more accessible to many people that are non-banks as well. So for now it&#8217;s meant mostly for speculators and hopefully in the future, we&#8217;ll see more common people interact with these protocols.</p>



<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: </strong>[00:09:34] Well, yeah, it&#8217;s good to hear that because I kind of,&nbsp; when I think back to how all this started, it was about democratizing and taking away the real sense of authority and not being bound by specific regulations, but making them yourselves, so all consensus and agreements. And so it kind of flies a little bit in the face of having to exclude people if we can&#8217;t do that. So we&#8217;ll keep an eye on where that&#8217;s going. And another question in the terrestrial financial world, let&#8217;s call it, especially around lending for example, we have a lot of aggregator platforms where the information is together, you can access things. Does that exist in the DeFi world?</p>



<p><strong>David Stancel: </strong>[00:10:11] Oh, yeah. We do know what are called, like DeFi aggregators, or perhaps a kind of DeFi UI user interface aggregators, because now we have really like a whole spectrum of protocols. And for people like&nbsp; for the power users who have been using all of them, it&#8217;s quite hard to keep track of all of them. So what is now being created and becoming increasingly more popular are these kind of&nbsp; aggregator slash integrators where on one single page, basically you just log in with your Ethereum address which we also mentioned the last time that this kind of a single sign on for the crypto world. And these applications or these aggregators read your transaction history. They can tell you which protocols you interacted with, where are your&nbsp; assets, maybe what kind of yield is on those assets as of now, because this is something that is dynamically changing in the DeFi space, which is very interesting. And of course, there&#8217;s a very important to mention is that one of the incentives, and one of the reasons why people play around with these protocols is that yelds in these protocols are much higher than in a like a C applications, even on an stable coin. So having a dollar in the bank account and having the dollar on blockchain can be really, really different experience.&nbsp; Not only because of different UI experiences, but mainly because that in the DeFi road, you can get like easily, like 10, 12% per annum on your dollars.&nbsp; Kind of very low risk-free way.</p>



<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: </strong>[00:11:53] Wow. Now I can see why people would then want to get involved as well. If we continue to stay the way we are in a traditional environment where there&#8217;s interest rates in new zero, most of the world. Is not very attractive, is it? You mentioned the blockchain and in this context, and is there a blockchain that&#8217;s the main DeFi venue?</p>



<p><strong>David Stancel: </strong>[00:12:14] Yeah, I think we mentioned it to us last time that the, for now it&#8217;s still Ethereum. Even though there are a lot of competitors, you know, entering this pace and trying to compete with Ethereum. But even though most of them actually are trying to more kind of compliment Ethereum and be sort of an extension of Ethereum itself. So that&#8217;s why most of them kind of copied the Ethereum virtual machine. So all the smart contracts on top of Ethereum are easy to deploy on these other&nbsp; blockchains. And that&#8217;s why also we see that there are lots of so-called bridges being built, where you can transfer easily assets from Ethereum to these other blockchains, such as Cardano, Solana, near Avalanche and so on and so on. So you can transfer assets between these blockchains in a easy in ideally trustless way.</p>



<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: </strong>[00:13:11] Okay. So that makes sense as well as it gets more congested, you need&nbsp; other ways to be able to literally, I suppose, move it around. You spoke about the fact that this, a lot of this is industry people that have been in it and they&#8217;re in it intensely and that it hasn&#8217;t yet rolled out to let&#8217;s call it the general public, because partly to do with these problems to do with the technologies and other things. But one thing that has captured the imagination, I think of the general public is NFTs. And there&#8217;s those people sitting on either side of the debate here, aren&#8217;t they people saying, what is this? You know, is this real?&nbsp; Is it virtual art? Is it real life? What&#8217;s the deal in the token there? What&#8217;s fungible mean? For example, when it says non fungible token, is it something that&#8217;s going to stick around? Is it something that&#8217;s a fad?&nbsp; I was listening to someone last week say, well, maybe we should get involved in this and someone else saying, well, no, we get enough about that. This is not going to be around for much longer. It&#8217;s just something that&#8217;s fad. So let&#8217;s roll it back again as we have been doing. What is an NFT, cause it is capturing the imagination? .</p>



<p><strong>David Stancel: </strong>[00:14:14] NFT&#8217;s are basically tokens like any others, but unlike the regular tokens, which are kind of&nbsp; interchangeable because they have the same quality, same properties and that&#8217;s why we call them fungible non-funded, but tokens are unique in some ways. So they usually have a kind of unique set of traits or they are basically unique. And each of the NFT tokens, it has some unique properties. The first wave on the hype of NFTs was like in end of 2017 with CryptoKitties, which caused lots of hysteria on the market and basically at some point, this single applications almost paralyzed the whole Ethereum network. At that point in time, then during 2018-2019, it was the whole market was dead for a long time. And now we could see in the last few months, again, kind of resurrection of the NFTs, which became very popular, especially among the artists that found a way in NFTs to monetize their art and digital art usually. Even though they are in some cases where it was that with physical art. So long story short NFTs can represent multiple kinds of assets. Typically they are use for art as mentioned, but probably kind of more meaningful use case for those for NFTs will be game assets from different virtual worlds. Because a lot of gamers deal with this problem that they invest lots of time and resources in building their characters in some particular games. And they collect lots of virtual items, but once they decide to leave that particle ecosystem, it&#8217;s not liquid. They don&#8217;t have much to do with their assets. And the NFTs and the common standard for the NFT trading Ethereum blockchain allows all these assets to become more liquid and that&#8217;s of course, very desirable for many people.</p>



<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: </strong>[00:16:16] So I suppose in a way,&nbsp; I remember for many years back now, probably around 2012-2013, there were people that were trying to help gamers to monetize without having just the publishers make all the money before they actually were able to monetize themselves. So this has been a problem that&#8217;s existed in that space and that, and the professionals for quite a while. And I get, and as I&#8217;m listening to you, I&#8217;m kind of thinking of the parallels and what happened with music as well. In terms of artists who were losing their rights or people were copying it and they were finding different&nbsp; ways to actually make sure that they got compensated when it went out onto like streaming platforms and things like that as well. I&#8217;m kind of stretching thinking, well, I see the Mona Lisa one tokenized and&nbsp; an NFT but&nbsp; as you said,&nbsp; it&#8217;s mostly&nbsp; digital art with a little bit of other that&nbsp; we&#8217;ve seen it in the public eye capturing the public life, but there&#8217;s a more serious side behind it for the gameing industry as well. What do you think, is this something that&#8217;s going to stick around or is this something that I don&#8217;t want to call it a fad, but is it a phase and will something replace it?</p>



<p><strong>David Stancel: </strong>[00:17:20] I think what we could see in the past months, it was definitely a lots of hype with unreasonable expectations and some of the events that happened, I think there are lots of price level in the whole NFT market was unreasonably high in my opinion, on the other hand, I do believe there will be lots of meaningful applications there, because the whole world is getting digitalized and there will be just more and more digital assets, whatever it means it can be an all like your university diploma will be digital assets for the future. And, this is probably one way where we will see also application of NFTs in the future. Some universities already experiment with that. We will see if they will eventually call it NFTs or not, or if it will be just a digital certificate. But we will definitely see these kind of use cases more and they will sustain. For example, one of the very interesting applications in my opinion are that there are some of the VR worlds . They tokenize the land in their virtual world. And again, this land has a form of NFT tokens. And again, this is quite the lively market that has been going on for the last almost two years let&#8217;s say. Even though it was mostly underrated from the mainstream media, but it&#8217;s there, it&#8217;s growing. And it&#8217;s one of the, in my opinion, very convenient and appropriate use cases for it. Maybe to back to&nbsp; your questions. If we will see them on a Liza being tokenized once. We definitely can tokenize physical assets as well, but it comes with different trade of and different risks because always, if you want to tokenize something physical, you need to reliably connect it to the blockchain and it&#8217;s kind of an issue we can do it, but there is still some trust needed for it. And that&#8217;s why I think it&#8217;s kind of more complicated than NFT&#8217;s makes sense mostly in the realm of digital world.</p>



<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: </strong>[00:19:23] And that makes sense as well, because if you think about it, as you said, how much digital data we have, and then you hear this kind of horror stories where people potentially pass away or something like that and no one knows where all these digital assets are because they haven&#8217;t shared keys or they haven&#8217;t shared in access to them in any other kind of way. And I guess as we move more that way, we need to find ways for us in our daily lives to be able to use that you mentioned the whole university side of things. When I think about it, I&#8217;ve had to get copies. I have a physical copy of one of my degrees certificates in a frame and every time I go to do something, I have to put it on a photocopier. It&#8217;s actually do something with it. It&#8217;s crazy in this day and age, right? But if something happened to that, hopefully that, the store that they have on them, I can go back to the birth certificates. I mean, there&#8217;s lots of things that I could imagine. From a practical point of view, that doesn&#8217;t mean that this shared ownership in any of this, clearly that&#8217;s just more like a, the storage and access side of things. And I think that&#8217;s interesting that it&#8217;s digital world as opposed to a physical world. And I think I feel a bit less cynical about it now, having had this conversation with you. And maybe to some of our listeners and some of us subscribers, they might feel the same thing and we might stay more in tune. Also it&#8217;s been really great to go through the DeFi because every time I hear it and everyone&#8217;s talking about decentralized finance, I think I don&#8217;t really understand what this is. We all want to know what these terms mean. And our whole journey from blockchain to Ethereum, to DeFi to NFTs, came about, because we realized that sometimes when you&#8217;re in the bubble, you don&#8217;t look outside and see how other people perceive it. We want to at Vacuumlabs, we want to share all as much information with us subscribers as possible. So I&#8217;ve enjoyed the series. Thank you, David, for educating us along the way. It&#8217;s been super enjoyable. We&#8217;re not in one of your university classes, but we&#8217;ve learned on the job as it were. And I hope that we&#8217;ll be picking up again and seeing where everything goes as this space evolves.</p>
