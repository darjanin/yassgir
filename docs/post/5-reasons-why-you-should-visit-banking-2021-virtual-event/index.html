        According to
        <a
          href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/financial-services/financial-services-industry-outlooks/banking-industry-outlook.html"
          >Delloitte&#8217;s 2021 banking and capital markets outlook</a
        >, the consequences of the pandemic are reshaping the global banking
        industry; they are ushering in a new competitive landscape. This is
        stifling growth in some traditional product areas, and prompting a new
        wave of innovation in others; it’s recasting the role of branches, and
        of course, accelerating digitization. Are you ready to seize the
        opportunities? Don’t miss
        <a href="https://www.vacuumlabs.com/banking2021">Banking 2021</a>, a
        virtual event hosted by

        and
        <a href="https://manifestogrowth.com/">Manifesto Growth Architects</a>!
        Here are five reasons why:
      </p>

      <h3>
        1. <strong>Bring your vision to life with the right technology</strong>
      </h3>

      <p>
        Whether you are an incumbent bank or a new entrant wanting to launch new
        services, modern <strong>cloud-native technologies</strong> and
        <strong>API-driven fintech services</strong> provide you with the
        ability to build your propositions and go to market rapidly.

          >Vacuumlabs</a
        >
        will highlight some of the key technology considerations when planning
        to launch new profitable products, as well as sharing the top 3 pitfalls
        to avoid—and the top 3 things to get right.
      </p>

        <strong
          >Build profitable customer relationships: it’s never been more
          important</strong
        >
      </h3>

      <p>
        With the Financial Technology revolution driving the democratisation and
        inclusivity agenda of financial services globally, continued and
        sustainable growth has to be the <strong>Number One</strong> priority in
        today’s landscape. Investor fatigue is common across many markets, so
        any fintech or digital bank launching today has to slam-dunk the “Three
        P’s” to succeed: Purpose, Partnerships, and most importantly,
        Profitability. Neil Harris from GPS will share his experience,
        knowledge, and thoughts on this topic during the Banking 2021 panel
        discussion and a roundtable ‘Building the right ecosystem‘.
      </p>

      <h3><strong>&nbsp;3. Learn from real-life case studies</strong></h3>

      <p>
        Working with tier one banks around the world requires a company-wide
        commitment to the
        <strong
          >highest standards of security, delivery, engineering and
          compliance</strong
        >. Thought Machine has gained considerable experience, from its
        engagement with Lloyds Banking Group, to Standard Chartered, and
        continues to refine and improve its processes with every client. This
        includes its approach to shipping features, its resourcing and its
        strict processes around security, audits and compliance.
