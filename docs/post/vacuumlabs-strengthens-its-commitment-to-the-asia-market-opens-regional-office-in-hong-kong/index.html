<p>Over the past few years, Central Europe based Vacuumlabs has been diligently working on a number of technologically innovative Fintech projects in Asia. From being the <a href="https://resources.vacuumlabs.com/thought-machine-paper">first to implement Thought Machine in Asia</a> as the foundation for one of the first virtual banks in Hong Kong, to creating cryptocurrency on a new blockchain technology, Vacuumlabs is well positioned to challenge its teams of highly qualified engineers and developers to push the boundaries of software development.</p>



<p>This summer, Vacuumlabs proudly <a href="http://www.sparq.cc/blog/vacuumlabs-to-expand-in-asia-with-a-new-regional-headquarters-in-hong-kong">announced</a> its partnership with Sparq Capital in Hong Kong. When the executive team first met <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelbruck/">Michael Bruck</a> at the Hong Kong Fintech Week in 2019, we immediately “clicked” and started discussing how to work together to strengthen Vacuumlabs’s presence in the region and be closer to the leading Fintech innovation taking place in Asia, as well as be able to provide better support to our partners, from startups and scaleups to corporates. Michael and Donna will guide the company’s strategy to grow sales and partnerships in the APAC region.</p>
