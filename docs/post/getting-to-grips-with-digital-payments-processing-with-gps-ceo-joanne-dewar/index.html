<p>Have you ever considered how digital payments actually work? Paying for supermarket groceries with your card or mobile phone is very convenient. Yet, the approval process behind digital payments is rather complex. Joanne Dewar of Global Processing Services (GPS), a pioneer in paytech and the developer of GPS Apex, a global issuer processing platform, says GPS was in the right place at the right time&nbsp; when they developed their flexible platform. This has helped the company secure big name customers such as $5.5bn neobank Revolut, digital card issuer Curve, and UK digital bank Monzo. The GPS platform is also accredited by Mastercard and Visa.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“We were fully tokenized from the outset, which meant that new fintech startups didn&#8217;t need to worry about their PCI certification. We were really the only processor that had the functionality that they were looking for and whether they were going into debit or prepaid, all of those features and functionality enables real-time alerts on your mobile phone. We were able to get to a place where we could say that transactions ‘just happened’. The platform needs to be up all the time in order to achieve that.” &#8211; Joanne Dewar, GPS</p></blockquote>



<p><strong>Strong relationships are key</strong></p>



<p>A flexible platform was just one piece of the puzzle. Another piece centres around strong and enduring relationships. Right from the outset, GPS was able to go on the journey with customers, knowing that their day one starting point is a rather different place from where they’ll be in three years’ time. Today, the company provides the backbone service for fintech, digital banks, and e-wallets and its global issuer processing platform is now used by more than 180+ customers in 60 countries worldwide.</p>



<p>Initial hard graft has paid off and GPS has developed a well-earned reputation for trustworthiness and has secured many high-profile loyal customers. Sticking close to many of the digital banking heavyweights and garnering as much experience as possible, GPS is now a poster child for best practice, as Joanne Dewar recounts:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Mark Bailey was branching out and wanted to be able to create a challenger bank from within the megalith that is RBS, and in that relationship he said: “Treat me like a traditional bank. Talk to me as you would to any other fintech. GPS is the one that has launched 250 programmes. We want to learn from you in terms of what typically goes wrong. Where are the learning points? What are the things you have to get right before you go live?” We were able to share our experience.” &#8211; Joanne Dewar, GPS</p></blockquote>



<p>GPS helps their customers navigate a highly complex market, and Joanne Dewar believes GPS is well-equipped with the knowledge and experience to help guide them through this maze:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“And again, that&#8217;s where the partnership comes in. We&#8217;re able to help people navigate that complexity because we&#8217;ve been there, done it. We&#8217;ve had a taste of&nbsp; lots of different flavours. We&#8217;ve seen what works, we’ve seen what doesn&#8217;t. Our customers have an idea, they&#8217;ve got a solution. They want to get to market and we can help them figure out the things that they need to do in order to get that solution in play.” &#8211; Joanne Dewar, GPS</p></blockquote>



<p><strong>Financial inclusion and a cashless society</strong></p>



<p>So what does the future hold? According to Joanne, we are going to see an acceleration towards becoming a cashless society. During the COVID-19 pandemic, merchants and their customers showed a strong preference for cashless payments and that trend is going to continue growing. But Joanne says there are still obstacles to surmount, particularly in terms of broadening financial inclusion:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“With the acceleration in the use of digital payments and the move away from cash, the financial inclusion agenda is a hundred times more important because there are still way too many people that are a hundred percent reliant on cash. And I think from a financial inclusion perspective, the moment is around how the government engages with&nbsp; digital payments and what that leads to in terms of adoption. The key is you can&#8217;t let one side of things accelerate beyond the other, moving towards a cashless economy society means striking the right balance and making sure no one gets left behind.&#8221; &#8211; Joanne Dewar, GPS</p></blockquote>
