<p>In late 2017, we bought a few coins and wanted to store them securely. The whole ecosystem was relatively immature, so we decided to implement a good wallet that&#8217;d be secure enough, and that&#8217;d suit our needs. It seemed pretty straightforward; you do some crypto-mojo of hashing and signing in Javascript and broadcast the resulting transaction. This is kind of a task which makes you ask yourself, &#8220;OK, and what will I do in the afternoon?&#8221; Obviously, we couldn&#8217;t be more wrong.</p>
