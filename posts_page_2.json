While it may be straightforward to scrape through on Slack and Zoom calls for a couple of weeks, as enforced remote working continues and temporary measures start to show their cracks, <strong>more permanent solutions may be called for<\/strong>.<br><br><strong>This post is going to focus on the performance aspect<\/strong> of managing a remote team and how to ensure team members are still producing work on time to a high standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/computer-1245714_1920-1-1191x791.jpg\" alt=\"Remote Development\" class=\"wp-image-1841\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Why might this be different in a remote working situation? Regular, <strong>personal check-ins are easy to manage in person<\/strong>. Asking your co-worker to help with a difficult task can be done in minutes when they are at the next desk. But when you\u2019re all <a href=\"https:\/\/inside.vacuumlabs.com\/community\/how-to-connect-people-during-times-of-isolation\">isolated in your own office<\/a>, it can be easy to feel like you can\u2019t reach out. Scrums and stand-ups might not be as effective in getting around all members of the team when they are done remotely. Despite the best efforts of everyone, <strong>performance levels can drop if not managed effectively and compassionately<\/strong>.<br><br>So, what can you do if you\u2019re forced to manage the performance of a remote team for longer than you had originally planned for?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Briefs and Communication<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ensuring the clarity of information everybody requires to do their job effectively is always a challenge. <strong>When working in sprints, you need to have a colossal amount of information ready to enable the team to do their job<\/strong>, and often it can be difficult to get everybody the information they need on time.<br><br>In an office situation that isn\u2019t always the end of the world. As long as the developers have 90% of the information they need to get started at 9 am, you can always get together later in the day to finish the last pieces. But <strong>when working remotely and faced with back to back calls<\/strong>, it\u2019s not always possible to do this in a remote situation. As a result, <strong>work slips and deadlines are impacted<\/strong>.<br><br>As a Product Manager or anybody overseeing the timeline, <strong>getting accurate and complete information to the wider team is crucial<\/strong> if projects are to stay on track and deadlines are hit. While remote working brings a whole host of additional challenges, <strong>clarity of briefs and ensuring the correct information gets to the right teams on time will save slipping deadlines<\/strong> adding to these challenges.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/inside.vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/92925-1209x791.jpg\" alt=\"Remote Development\" class=\"wp-image-1845\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Taking the Sticky Note Board Online \u2013 Best Scrum Tools<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the prevalence of online task management tools out there,<strong> the agile development experience is still dominated by the office scrum board<\/strong> <strong>covered in sticky notes<\/strong> that the team relies upon to get quick updates on project progress.<br><br><strong>Taking this online is key to driving the continued performance of your team and your project.<\/strong> But with the amount of choice on the market, how do you know which is the right virtual scrum board for you?

Scrums are going to run differently when they are done remotely. You can\u2019t just pop over for a quick chat with someone when you have a question. <strong>People can\u2019t just talk over the water cooler or in the kitchen over lunch.<\/strong> It is these types of interactions that help improve productivity, get ideas communicated and builds trust and support within teams and the wider organization.<br><br>So how can you replicate this across a dispersed team?<br><br>There are <strong>three ways to successfully manage a remote development team<\/strong>:<br><br>1. Get Connected<br>2. Feel Connected<br>3. Stay Connected<br><br>So what does all this mean? Let\u2019s take a look.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Manage the logistics in place<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve all been there. The call that is booked in for 2 pm but by 2.20 pm you\u2019re all still trying to get on the line. Videos are cutting out, nobody knows how to share the screen and the agenda is a bit of a mystery. What should have been a 15-minute catch-up has turned into an hour-long ordeal with little in the way of meaningful actions.<br><br>And it\u2019s not just video calls. Does everyone have the right platforms for chatting to each other during the day? Are the right people being involved in the right conversations? <strong>Is information being too widely spread between Slack, email and any other document sharing sites that are being used?<\/strong><br><br><strong>Getting Connected is about putting the logistics in place<\/strong> and having the right platforms in place for the right purpose. More than that, it is about <strong>communicating this effectively to your team<\/strong> so everyone understands how it all works, making communication and clarity just as effective as if you were all in the same room.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"854\" src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/top-view-photo-of-girl-watching-through-imac-4144294-_resize.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1760\" srcset=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/top-view-photo-of-girl-watching-through-imac-4144294-_resize.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/top-view-photo-of-girl-watching-through-imac-4144294-_resize-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/top-view-photo-of-girl-watching-through-imac-4144294-_resize-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/top-view-photo-of-girl-watching-through-imac-4144294-_resize-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Break the technology wall<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have all of the logistics in place and people know where to log on, where to leave feedback and how to use all of the tools you have in place, the next step is to <strong>make people feel connected to each other when they are sitting home alone<\/strong>.<br><br>This is building in the ability to replicate some of the more informal conversations around the office, but also ensuring that people are heard during calls and picking up on hints that things might be ok.<br><br>It could be <strong>simple things like asking people how their weekends were<\/strong> at the start of calls, phoning people one to one just to see how they are doing and not just listening to the loudest voice in the room when in group meetings.<br><br>Replicating the camaraderie between members of the team is crucial in a high pressure, highly stressful role where a lot is riding on meeting deadlines and getting things right. Putting the channels in place to encourage this is the first step. But encourage your team to use these just to blow off steam or talk about what they watched on TV last night to build some of the feelings of connectivity that can be lost when working remotely.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Avoid losing the connection<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the hardest parts of remote working is <strong>retaining a sense of company culture<\/strong> among a team that has no physical touchpoints. No Friday beers, no lunchtime table tennis, and no company socials. Getting across the company values and making the team feel valued is hard when they are distributed, but that\u2019s not to say that you shouldn\u2019t bother.<br><br>Many teams are looking to online socials such as video movie nights, games nights and getting together on a video call to share a beer after work on a Friday. <strong>The important thing is to reach out and make that connection to make people feel part of something bigger.<\/strong><br><br>We\u2019ve written extensively about each of these points in our whitepaper: How to Successfully Manage a Remote Development Team.

Do you also find social distancing difficult these days?<br><br>During the last week of March 2020, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hackthecrisis.sk\/\">Hack the Crisis<\/a> Hackathon movement appeared in our internal channels at Vacuumlabs and started a conversation about whether we could contribute to the event in any way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2523\" height=\"512\" src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Hack-the-Crisis.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1678\" srcset=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Hack-the-Crisis.png 2523w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Hack-the-Crisis-300x61.png 300w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Hack-the-Crisis-1024x208.png 1024w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Hack-the-Crisis-768x156.png 768w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Hack-the-Crisis-1536x312.png 1536w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Hack-the-Crisis-2048x416.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2523px) 100vw, 2523px\" \/><figcaption>Hack the Crisis Slovakia<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Insight and motivation<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The purpose of our first conference call was to find an idea that provides an added value in the current epidemic situation, something we can all be enthusiastic about. Among the listed possibilities we saw an <strong>eye-catching description explaining the negative effects of physical distancing<\/strong>. An interesting study claimed, that<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-default\"><p>\u2018Being socially isolated is as bad for your health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day.\u2019<br>&#8211;American Psychological Association<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>When we started to talk about this statement, more and more <strong>personal stories came up<\/strong> <strong>about depression, isolated family members and friends, and changing good daily routines<\/strong>, such as leaving healthy eating habits behind due to the pandemic. At that very moment, I think all of us felt like this was the right path to take.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The idea &#8211; Bear with Life<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The core idea was about creating an application, where you can invite the people of your <a href=\"https:\/\/inside.vacuumlabs.com\/fintech\/the-rise-of-the-tribe-and-the-role-of-the-bank-the-tribal-banking-manifesto\">tribe<\/a>. This social platform provides you a list of challenges to take and if you accept them, you will have them under <strong>\u2018My challenges\u2019<\/strong> to complete. Once the required act is completed, you can upload a photo as a proof and hit <strong>\u2018Challenge completed\u2019<\/strong>. After completion, the app is asking about your mood and also offers a field to <strong>record how you felt<\/strong>. Writing down your thoughts or \u2018journaling\u2019 helps you to better understand your mental state and gain control over your emotions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Bearwithlife_montage02_2-1.png\" alt=\"Social activity\" class=\"wp-image-1687\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"4252\" height=\"2126\" src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Bearwithlife_montage01_2.png\" alt=\"Social activity\" class=\"wp-image-1686\" srcset=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Bearwithlife_montage01_2.png 4252w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Bearwithlife_montage01_2-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Bearwithlife_montage01_2-1024x512.png 1024w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Bearwithlife_montage01_2-768x384.png 768w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Bearwithlife_montage01_2-1536x768.png 1536w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Bearwithlife_montage01_2-2048x1024.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 4252px) 100vw, 4252px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Some examples of the challenges we created:<br><br>Create a Spotify playlist \ud83c\udfa7<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Change can be stressful no matter what causes it.

This is the reason why we had no issues with remote teamwork, we are already used to communicating over Zoom, GoogleHangouts or Slack. We dedicated a weekend to the project, each one of us contributed to the final result as much as they could. In total, we had less than 50 hours to put something on the table.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>UI\/UX<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the first steps was creating our brand guide. We agreed on our name &#8216;Bear with Life&#8217;, we picked out the fonts to use and also decided on the colors of our application. Besides, we had a clear idea of the logo, we wanted something bear-related with a heart shape, possibly referring to the social distance we have to keep these days.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"4252\" height=\"2126\" src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Bearwithlife_montage05_3.png\" alt=\"Color Guide\" class=\"wp-image-1699\" srcset=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Bearwithlife_montage05_3.png 4252w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Bearwithlife_montage05_3-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Bearwithlife_montage05_3-1024x512.png 1024w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Bearwithlife_montage05_3-768x384.png 768w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Bearwithlife_montage05_3-1536x768.png 1536w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Bearwithlife_montage05_3-2048x1024.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 4252px) 100vw, 4252px\" \/><figcaption>Color Guide<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For design creations, we started with <strong>Whimsical <\/strong>where we drafted our flows.

So why not spend the time productively? One of the options is self-development and <a href=\"https:\/\/inside.vacuumlabs.com\/technology\/5-great-educational-sources-for-software-engineers\">education<\/a>. Our team member Andy Skok, a Kiwi Search Front-end Tech Lead, has hand-picked sources of great talks, podcasts, blogs and many more wells of wisdom. These are his best tips for content streams he uses daily to improve his coding knowledge.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Subscribe to high-quality channels on Youtube&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While the peak of YouTube\u2019s fame might be over, this good old friend offers tons of great video knowledge. As a Front-end Developer, Andy subscribes to the conference channels such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/jsconfeu\"><strong>JSConf<\/strong><\/a><strong>, <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCwoOpKfkyCQHW562hXXQAGg\"><strong>Codegram<\/strong><\/a><strong>, <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCBHdUnixTWymmXBIw12Y8Qg\"><strong>ReactiveConf<\/strong><\/a><strong>, <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/ClojureTV\"><strong>ClojureTV<\/strong><\/a><strong> or <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCorlLn2oZfgOJ-FUcF2eZ1A\"><strong>ReactEurope<\/strong><\/a><strong>.<\/strong> He also often wanders through the channels of tech giants like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/FacebookDevelopers\"><strong>Facebook<\/strong><\/a><strong> or <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/GoogleDevelopers\"><strong>Google Devs<\/strong><\/a>. As a true developer by the hearth, Andy falls asleep listening to more content-tiring channels like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCQPYJluYC_sn_Qz_XE-YbTQ\"><strong>Node.js.<\/strong><\/a><br><br><strong>PRO TIP:<\/strong> Andy checks the channels a few months after the conference. This way, he can sort the videos by popularity and possibly filter exciting talks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"ReactiveConf 2019 - Richard Feldman: Predicting the Future of the Web\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/okrB3aJtUaw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Give your eyes a bit of rest while listening to podcasts<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While being of lower quality than YouTube, there\u2019s no better way to devote time to self-development during the morning commute than listen to a podcast. Said everyone in 2019. The big boom of recorded-interviews listening instead of music streams has also brought lots of quality content into our ears. Andy notes <a href=\"https:\/\/changelog.com\/master\"><strong>Changelog Master Feed<\/strong><\/a> as his favourite show. His list continues with <a href=\"https:\/\/frontendhappyhour.com\/\"><strong>Frontend Happy Hour<\/strong><\/a> by Netflix Engineers (he also says the hosts drink during recording, so it\u2019s fun, but we shouldn\u2019t promote that), <a href=\"https:\/\/podcast.bretfisher.com\/\"><strong>DevOps and Docker Talk<\/strong><\/a><strong>, <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.se-radio.net\/\"><strong>Software Engineering Radio<\/strong><\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bikeshed.fm\/\"><strong>The Bike Shed<\/strong><\/a><strong>.<\/strong>&nbsp;<br><br><strong>PRO TIP:<\/strong> You should actually listen to the podcasts during the morning commute for the best experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Scroll through devs\u2019 profiles on Twitter<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What\u2019s a better source for hot topics than Twitter? The feed\u2019s always full of the latest information. Andy\u2019s favourite experts from the field are <strong>Sean Larkin, Lambda Conf, Eric Elliott, Jeff Atwood, Andrew Clark, Wes Bos, Kent C Dodds, David Abramov <\/strong>and many many others covering topics from Frontend development to Programming theory, conferences and technology news.<br><br><strong>PRO TIP:<\/strong> No pro tip here, sorry.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>[cta_to_website]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Save and read articles on online sources<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A well-known online knowledge-publishing platform Medium is also full of the golden stuff. Many developers turn to this site to improve their coding skills or just read something interesting. Andy browses the platform more freely rather than systematically, saves what catches his eye and then reads the content later on. He also applies this wandering process on more sites than just Medium. Whether it\u2019s Hackernoon or Reddit and its specific programming subreddit, good knowledge always finds a curious programmer.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>PRO TIP: <\/strong>Save your articles for later reading. Andy uses <a href=\"http:\/\/www.getpocket.com\">Pocket<\/a> (no ad intended).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/inside.vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/simon-abrams-k_T9Zj3SE8k-unsplash-1187x791.jpg\" alt=\"Self-development software developer\" class=\"wp-image-1640\"\/><figcaption>Photo by Simon Abrams via Unsplash<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Open programming theory books<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many content-heavy but excellent books about Computer Science and Programming. From <a href=\"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/108986.Introduction_to_Algorithms\">algorithms<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/166195.Modern_Operating_Systems?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=oRA3kXEwCC&amp;rank=1\">operating systems design<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/703102.Compilers\">compilers<\/a> to type theory, everyone will find what satisfies their needs. However, Andy adds that for this type of activity, you need to find some time as together with other four sources, his tempo is just a few pages a week.<br><br><strong>PRO TIP: <\/strong>Try this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/43713.Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs\">book<\/a> used by MIT if you\u2019re new to programming<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conquer Steam leaderboards<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Computer Science and programming theory can be exhausting and, sometimes, we don&#8217;t have the energy for self-development the typical way. So why not combine it with gaming to have some fun? Andy&#8217;s favourite ones are <a href=\"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/504210\/SHENZHEN_IO\/\">SHENZEN I\/O,<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/365450\/Hacknet\/\">Hacknet<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/619150\/while_True_learn\/\">while True: learn()<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/375820\/Human_Resource_Machine\/\">Human Resource Machine<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/792100\/7_Billion_Humans\/\">7 Billion Humans<\/a>.

The fintech scene in Hungary is still in its early days but it has been growing rapidly over the last few years. Since we opened our newest office in Budapest a year ago, we became a part of this vibrant ecosystem and connected with many local players. We hopped on a Zoom call with some of them to learn how they deal with the current situation and hear their thoughts and predictions about the upcoming trends, challenges, and potential opportunities.<br><br>The local fintech community had some good years behind its back. One of the most notable success stories was the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.finextra.com\/newsarticle\/25704\/misys-acquires-ind-group\">acquisition of IND Group by Mysis<\/a> in 2014. Since then, we have seen a growing number of fintech startups getting both local and regional traction with notable investments. Our friends from BoosterLabs identified 48 innovative Hungarian-founded fintech companies in their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theboosterlabs.com\/post\/hungarian-fintech-landscape\">study<\/a> last year. According to the research of the <strong>Magyar Nemzeti Bank<\/strong> (the Central Bank of Hungary), altogether nearly 110 Hungarian and foreign-owned fintech companies are represented in the domestic market, the vast majority of them, nearly 90 percent, provide B2B services. The entire sector employed nearly 5,000 people in 2019 and their sales revenue reached almost HUF 120 billion.<br><br>Nearly every bank runs innovation programs and seeks collaboration with startups in Hungary. Magyar Nemzeti Bank launched its Innovation Hub in Q1 2018 and its Regulatory Sandbox framework at the end of 2018 in order to ensure a safe environment for testing innovative financial solutions. In October 2019 the central bank also published its<a href=\"https:\/\/www.mnb.hu\/letoltes\/mnb-fintech-strategy-eng-cov.pdf\"> FinTech Strategy<\/a> including 24 recommendations to improve the supportive environment and boost the digitalization of financial services. In addition, at the beginning of 2020, it conducted a survey of the Hungarian banking sectors\u2019 digital development to gain a comprehensive picture of the current state of financial digitalization.<br><br><strong>TransferWise<\/strong>, Europe\u2019s most valuable fintech startup, also opened an office in Budapest in 2017. Now employing over 300 people it has become their third-largest office after London and Tallinn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"960\" height=\"641\" src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/69212135_2392342661022697_8735409695570788352_o.jpg\" alt=\"Fintech\" class=\"wp-image-1563\" srcset=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/69212135_2392342661022697_8735409695570788352_o.jpg 960w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/69212135_2392342661022697_8735409695570788352_o-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/69212135_2392342661022697_8735409695570788352_o-768x513.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" \/><figcaption>Kristo K\u00e4\u00e4rmann, CEO and Co-founder of TransferWise, and Michael Callas, Chief Strategist of Vacuumlabs at TechTuesday meetup<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The meetup scene was buzzing lately in Budapest and there was a growing number of conferences connecting the local and regional fintech community. The cancellations of events and community gatherings are one of the first hits that impacts the community. We were looking forward to the first-ever Budapest Fintech Summit organized by MNB, where our CXO, Matej Ft\u00e1\u010dnik was scheduled to participate in a panel talk. The organizers were one of the firsts taking precautionary steps by announcing the cancellation at the end of February.<br><br>P\u00e9ter F\u00e1ykiss, Director of Digitalisation Directorate at the MNB said:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8216;Due to the given epidemiological situation, MNB decided to postpone the conference<em> <\/em>to protect the health of the participants. We hope that the global and domestic efforts will bear fruit soon, providing us an opportunity to communicate the new date of the Budapest FinTech Summit as soon as possible. We strongly believe that a large-scale conference with internationally renowned professionals can contribute to the development of the Hungarian Fintech sector and the digital transformation of incumbents through knowledge sharing and establishment of new business relations.&#8217;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><br>He also added that in situations like the current one, the role of digitalization is even more important and it most likely acts as a catalyst for the introduction of innovative solutions. The MNB has just announced &#8211; in an online press conference &#8211; for the first time their FinTech and Digitalization Report on the evolution of the active fintech firms in Hungary and the digitalization level of the Hungarian banking sector. Based on the results of the Report, the domestic banks are already providing fully digitally accessible financial services in some product segments, but there is still room for improvement. The Hungarian fintech sector has been able to expand dynamically in recent years and the MNB will continue to support financial innovation and a favorable environment for the development of the industry.<br><br>Local banks showed a great interest in seeking partnership opportunities with startups. Almost all major banks offer accelerator programs and OTP Group\u2019s CVC fund PortfoLion is one of the most successful venture capital funds in the country. One of the first local fintech accelerators was MKB Bank\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/fintechlab.hu\">Fintechlab<\/a> which has already incubated 22 startups, many of which relocated to Budapest from other regional hubs for the program. They also organize several meetups and conferences to boost the ecosystem, including the <strong>Budapest<\/strong> <strong>Design Summit<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/MKB-Fintechlab-1296x519.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1621\"\/><figcaption>MKB Fintechlab<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We discussed the current situation with Mary Alcantara, Deputy Managing Director at <strong>MKB Fintechlab<\/strong>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8216;Some of our events now have to be postponed or shifted to online platforms, but all of our core activities will continue. MKB Fintechlab has already extended the scope of its partnership program to include later-stage scaleups and companies before the crisis began. We have always been known for our work with startups, but we also built up a Design Competence Center and support the digital transformation of MKB Bank. In the fintech community, we\u2019re all just trying to stay positive.&nbsp; We collaborate a lot more these days and are bringing in new tools to support a faster-paced, connected way of work inside the bank. When you are an innovator, you see opportunity in every challenge &#8211; and there are definitely plenty of challenges in this new situation.&#8217;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Mary believes that founders must prepare for prolonged challenges, such as longer sale cycles and decreased demand. She predicts that nonessential businesses will have greater difficulty persevering during this economic change, but solutions that increase remote productivity or ease financial burdens on customers could see a boost.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/inside.vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/IMG_20200401_122729_136-791x791.jpg\" alt=\"Accelerator\" class=\"wp-image-1568\"\/><figcaption>Mary Alcantara, Deputy Managing Director at MKB Fintechlab<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>MKB Fintechlab has just gone live with their pilot project <a href=\"https:\/\/landing.linistry.com\/en\/\">Linistry Digital Queuing<\/a>. They were in discussions with the startup since January, but the pandemic situation actually resulted in accelerating the process, as MKB Bank wanted to quickly respond with a service that would benefit its customers. They made the service available in days to allow customers to book appointments online without queuing or waiting. This digital queuing feature is a huge help in following the recently announced social distancing regulations, minimizing time spent in branches.<br><br>Another key gathering of the local scene is the Fintechshow organized by FintechZone, a popular local fintech blog and knowledge center. The event was also postponed from the original date, 21 April 2020. FintechZone and MKB Fintechlab were also co-organizing the Hungarian edition of <a href=\"https:\/\/rendezveny.hwsw.hu\/hackthecrisis\/1\/hack-the-crisis-hackhathon\">Hack the Crisis<\/a>, an online hackathon to invite the tech community to build solutions for the socio-economic impact of the pandemic.<br><br>Teams could participate in the hackathon with creative projects for the following issues:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Save lives<\/li><li>Save communities<\/li><li>Save small businesses<\/li><li>Save education<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We talked to G\u00e1bor Lem\u00e1k, Co-founder of FintechZone and Fintechshow, also one of the organizers of the <strong>Hack the Crisis Hungary<\/strong> event,&nbsp; asking his opinion on the possible industry impact of the crisis:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8216;As a result of the coronavirus outbreak, many digital financial services have been launched during the last three weeks. The measures taken due to the epidemic have explicitly accelerated the appearance of digital projects. The restriction of personal customer services also contributed to the faster deployment of new applications, like digital contracting solutions and contactless payment options.<\/p><p>From my experience, digital channels are more valued lately in the bank sector, resources are reallocated to this area. Fintech solutions that offer a remote client identification, or fast-to-implement electronic payment solutions to businesses, may now be in a favorable position. Open banking (PSD2) methods can also provide help against the spread of the virus, fintech companies that deal with data-driven solutions can now be in the spotlight. We were also glad to see some related projects during the <strong>Hack the Crisis<\/strong> event this weekend.<\/p><p>At the same time, there are several domestic fintech companies that could find themselves in a difficult position due to the suspension of investments. In the upcoming months, many projects that will only pay off in the long run, will probably be on hold. We are confident that the fintech industry will find its way through this period and there will be a number of new solutions that we can present on our FinTechShow 20\/20.&#8217;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/inside.vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/T_BDP3016-528x791.jpg\" alt=\"Fintech community\" class=\"wp-image-1575\"\/><figcaption>G\u00e1bor Lem\u00e1k, Co-founder of FintechZone and Fintechshow<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Nobody really knows what is going to happen and how bad the economic crisis will be. One thing is sure, every crisis is also an opportunity. We have to adapt to the situation, make important measures and find solutions for unprecedented problems. We love the response and initiatives taken by some of the local fintech members.<br><br><strong>Mr Coin<\/strong>, <strong>CoinCash<\/strong> and <strong>InLock<\/strong>, some of the most recognized companies in the local crypto community have joined forces and launched <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bitcoinadomany.hu\/\">BitcoinAdom\u00e1ny<\/a>. This charity site aimed at helping doctors, nurses, and all healthcare workers who are fighting for coronavirus patients. The platform allows crypto donations where the conversion is free of charge. The organizers assure the community that the full amount will go to the foundation by running an amount tracker on the site in order to make the process more transparent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are fintech solutions which might even experience an increase in demand and have the ability to create opportunities from the turbulent market dynamics and changing customer behaviors<br><br><strong>TrustChain<\/strong> is an up-and-coming startup that has just raised its recent round to continue to build their platform that allows entrepreneurs, companies, and other businesses to create, negotiate, and sign documents on their devices in a digital, yet legally secure way in 38 countries. They prefer to define themselves as a RegTech company as they are helping to manage regulatory processes within the fintech sector through digital technology.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/TrustChain_webpage-1296x509.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1625\"\/><figcaption>TrustChain<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>An important factor that differentiates them from their competitors is that every contracting party has to go through a remote identification procedure before starting to use the contracting platform, where a Qualified Electronic signature will be linked to their account. The N:N business model they operate with is based on linking customers and suppliers together in a middle platform. This online contracting application allows businesses to manage any kind of document which requires authentication from different sides. Basically the platform helps companies to make formal binding agreements with legal security in the digital space. Since they have been on the market, they have already raised EUR 1.4M for their unique project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8216;The number of our customers has tripled since the outbreak. Legal digitalization is a new innovative area where clients are usually extra cautious. The secure authentication enables our users to sign documents like working contracts, company documents, investment contracts, trade agreements, agency contracts, purchase agreements in a safe way when contracting\/signing parties are afraid to meet or not able to meet personally because of distance.

We try to help all businesses who reach out to us with a request, paying special attention to reducing interactions and facilitating the contracting process. On a voluntary basis, we decided to provide financial advice to small and medium-sized companies. In many cases, companies do not need external funding, only some guidance, and ideas on how to maintain their businesses in the current situation. I know it sounds like a clich\u00e9, but we really believe that every crisis has a potential for growth.

The idea of a co-worker is changing. And lastly, the way we see companies as facilitators of a lifelong career is changing.\u00a0<br><br>I recently read <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/ideas\/archive\/2020\/02\/how-mckinsey-destroyed-middle-class\/605878\/\">an article in the Atlantic<\/a> about how McKinsey destroyed the Middle Class and the downfall of the lifelong full-time employee. It was eye-opening and got me thinking about what this means for the likes of my generation and the generations to come. It got me thinking about the gig economy, my professional career compared to my parents, and, naturally, how this will impact banking.\u00a0<br><br>One of the most striking statements for me in this article was:\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>&#8220;In effect, management consulting is a tool that allows corporations to replace lifetime employees with short-term, part-time and even subcontracted workers.&#8221;<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This concept of being a lifetime employee is something that seems alien to the Millennial generation. My parents were lifelong employees of the US Postal Service and throughout their 30 plus year careers had consistent feelings of security, friendship and companionship. For us who regularly move to new organisations, for the gig workers, or the growing workforce of freelancers, obtaining this security, fellowship and friendship is difficult for us to achieve in the workplace. But, just because we do not have this readily available, does not mean that it is something we do not value. We are still obtaining this, only in a different way from say our parents&#8217; generation, instead of through our many micro-tribes.\u00a0<br><br>The lifelong employee concept, and all the feelings of security and belonging that went along with it, goes hand in hand with the idea of the Credit Union in the US. My parents&#8217; bank with the US Postal Service Federal Credit Union. I bank with a handful of banks that I am loyal to based on price, customer service and the digital experiences they offer me. I don&#8217;t know one person my age who banks with a Credit Union. And this is why the Credit Unions may be in trouble.\u00a0<br><br>A\u00a0<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Credit_union\">credit union<\/a>\u00a0is a member-owned\u00a0<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Financial_institution\">financial<\/a>\u00a0<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cooperative\">cooperative<\/a>, democratically controlled by its members, and operated for the purpose of promoting thrift, providing\u00a0<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Credit_(finance)\">credit<\/a>\u00a0at competitive rates, and providing other financial services to its members. As of 2016, there were 5,757 credit unions, with 103.9 million members, comprising 45.5 per cent of the economically active population.\u00a0<br><br>Credit Unions are therefore unique for two reasons: once you deposit money, you become a member, and a large number of credit unions serve members working in a particular industry. There are credit unions for Employees of Harvard, NASA, and Teachers Unions. Credit Unions are also highly localised; for example, there is a credit union in the town I grew up in, that has a population of 25,000. They also support Scholarship programmes for their members. I remember applying for a scholarship offered for children of US Postal Service employees.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/image3-1-1024x677.png\" alt=\"credit unions\" class=\"wp-image-1609\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To become a member of the US Postal Service Federal Credit Union, a member has to be an employee or retiree of the USPS, or a household\/ family member (e.g. me or my mom), or an employee of Select Group. Select Groups include smaller companies ranging from Trash Removal to Detective Agencies.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"693\" src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/image2-1024x693.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1611\" srcset=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/image2-1024x693.png 1024w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/image2-300x203.png 300w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/image2-768x519.png 768w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/image2-1536x1039.png 1536w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/image2.png 1999w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The US Postal Service Federal Credit Union offers every type of financial product or service you can imagine would be needed by their members. They provide financial advice, lending, credit cards, mortgages, multiple types of credit cards, and of course, branches. They even offer information on Stamp collecting. Speaking to my parents (they are not stamp collectors), they have been members for over 30 years. It is their bank, and I can&#8217;t think of anything that would lead them to switch. This tends to be the case with most credit unions in the US, and as a result, they have incredibly high NPS scores and a highly loyal customer base. USAA, the bank for those in the Armed Services and their families is the envy of any bank in terms of customer loyalty and share of wallet.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"706\" src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/image1-1024x706.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1610\" srcset=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/image1-1024x706.png 1024w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/image1-300x207.png 300w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/image1-768x529.png 768w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/image1-1536x1059.png 1536w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/image1.png 1996w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Credit Unions may be in trouble with their existing business model. What if the US Postal Service hires contracted Uber-drivers to deliver the mail? What if the mail sorting becomes entirely automated by robots? Who will be the employees? Will they stay at the US Postal Service for life given this amount of automation? As mentioned, the gig workers, freelancers, and those of us on our third or fourth job are still in need of belonging and security.\u00a0<br><br>Our numbers are only growing, and I do not believe that people will continue to bank with Credit Unions. Instead, we will look to the support of our micro-tribes for everything from financial aid, events and even forums to support their family with issues like health care and education. This is where Tribal Banking will come in. In the absence of lifelong full-time employment, Tribal Banking will either augment or replace the traditional Credit Union.\u00a0<br><br>Let&#8217;s think about how Tribal Banking can fill the void. My parents were lifelong employees of the US Postal Service. I am on track to be a lifelong employee of the <a href=\"https:\/\/inside.vacuumlabs.com\/category\/fintech\">fintech<\/a> and or digital financial services industry. Here are five possible things the bank of the fintech industry could do for its tribe members.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Forums that help us understand the best product of service for our needs. Let&#8217;s be honest; most people in the fintech tribe use a whole host of fintechs, traditional banks, and mobile-only banks for testing and experimenting.\u00a0<\/li><li>Most of these fintechs and new banks acquire new customers based on referrals. The bank for the fintech industry could help its members get that extra $5 for referring to a fellow tribe member.\u00a0<\/li><li>Crowd-sourcing platform for new ideas. This could be anything from new fintech products or services, or membership groups supporting a sub-tribe, for example, Women of Color in fintech.\u00a0<\/li><li>Access to scholarships for those looking to pursue higher education in a fintech-related area<\/li><li>Peer to peer lending amongst the tribe<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These are just a snapshot of how a bank for the fintech industry could support its members both in terms of highly niche financial products but also forums, scholarships, and general support. This type of bank could surely help fill the gap of security, companionship, and friendship that was traditionally acquired from life-long full-time employment. With a little help from the new wave of Tribal Banking, the fear around the changing workforce ( due to not just the role of management consulting, but a much more connected world that facilitates gig workers and freelancers), can be subdued. We can have the same safety net and feeling of belonging that our parents and their parents had.\u00a0<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The way we work is changing.

Closing borders, <a href=\"https:\/\/inside.vacuumlabs.com\/community\/how-to-connect-people-during-times-of-isolation\">quarantining people<\/a> or shutting down shops and school, just to mention a few. However, the technology of the 21st century can shred a new light on the spread of the virus, using valuable data from people\u2019s smartphones. Some countries are, therefore, considering amending the legislation to allow them to use such data to slow the spread of the deadly virus.<br><br>Inspired by Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea, the Slovak government has passed a similar law to allow telecom data being used by the Public Health Office. Although aimed for a good cause, such a controversial ruling raises many valid questions regarding data privacy. Our Chief Legal Officer and the CEO of our legal spin-off <a href=\"https:\/\/sparring.io\/\">Sparring<\/a>, <strong>Marian Porvaznik,<\/strong> has been invited to the national news to answer the most critical questions about the law.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What data will be collected?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As the public mostly rejected the first proposal of the law, the government had to clarify the government would use only limited data. It concerns two main groups of the data provided by telecom operators:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Localisation data gathered through BTS antennas for anonymous user location<\/li><li>Data with identity such as name and phone to contact only those people who could have been in contact with an infected person or have visited an infected area<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As Marian further commented, collecting this information will only serve for limiting the spread of the novel coronavirus.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>[cta_to_website]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Can the government spy on Slovak citizens?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI can say that the current measures are not exactly spying,\u201d started the interview Marian. However, as he further adds, we need to be cautious about the steps of the government even if the situation asks for such unprecedented intervention into the privacy. Even Maria Kolikova, Slovakia\u2019s Minister of Justice, admitted the law is beyond acceptable under normal circumstances. Still, she emphasized in the state of a pandemic, some privacy is sacrificed for the greater good.<br><br>\u201cIt is the same with other rights, for example, freedom of speech: freedom of speech is not absolute. There are certain reasons why we can limit these rights\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009I\u2019m certain that if the protection of health and life is at stake, legislation like this is appropriate,\u201d <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/64539a44-6e87-11ea-89df-41bea055720b\">FT.com<\/a> cites Maria.&nbsp;<br><br>\u201cWe have to look on how this data is acquired,\u201d explains Marian when asked how can we be sure that the government will not misuse the data to spy on own people.  Also, he says that state institutions have the data from telecom providers, who dispose of much detailed information about its customers:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cThe telecom providers could already see into your bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, and they could even read your messages if they\u2019d wanted to. But they\u2019re controlled under a threat of considerable fines in a complex European law regarding data privacy. These operators have dedicated teams to ensure the categories of data collected, the anonymity of data and protection against any misuse or attack. Data protection is their primary goal.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>How will be the data used?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Marian also touched the fact that similar data gathering by public institutions is nothing new. For example, after the murder of Slovak journalist Jan Kuciak, police used localisation to identify potential criminals. The responsible authority controlled every operation. \u201cIt\u2019s even in our hands to ensure any data misuse. If someone thinks the Public Health Office (public office entitled to demand personal data in question) violates any law, they can easily ask, according to Slovak information law, for detailed information about who, how and what for and to what extent used the datasets,\u201d continued Marian.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"How does the new surveillance law affect our privacy \u2013 Marian Porvaznik in RTVS\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Rq5q12QPCGM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><figcaption>Marian Porvaznik in the RTVS<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Public Health Office, along with other analytical bodies, will then create precise models for monitoring and predicting the spread of the SARS-CoV-2. Monitoring of the population movement is essential during a pandemic. Furthermore, the Office will contact people who could have come in contact with infected persons or have been in the hotspot and also map their movement. Marian also adds that data of identified persons will be used to control if someone breaks imposed quarantine: \u201cIf we receive signal somewhere around Tatry region when that particular person should be at home in Bratislava, we can contact the person with an important message they could be spreading the virus and such behaviour is against the law. But revealing the identity of users will be mostly used for protecting the affected people.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Inspired by other countries<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Slovak law is said to be inspired by countries where similar surveillance is already operational. Other nations are also exploring how they can harness the technology into the fight against the virus: \u201cThe current state shows many countries using tech against the pandemic. China deployed drones equipped with facial recognition and others such as South Korea, Israel or Poland are also using apps or telecom data for surveillance.\u201d The examples show that such laws can help countries while relatively not breaking much of the privacy, if designed and executed as stated.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Marian Porvaznik, our CLO, explained the new coronavirus surveillance law in the national news.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":7,"featured_media":1547,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":""},"categories":[14],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v16.4 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Can Slovakia spy on citizens using data during COVID19 crisis? - Vacuumlabs<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Marian Porvaznik, our CLO, explained the use of data by the new coronavirus surveillance law.

That\u2019s where you go to store your money and hopefully see it grow over time. But that is now changing all around the world. A new wave of so-called \u2018fintechs\u2019 merge the world of technology and finance, providing easy access to mobile internet with the safety and security of traditional banking. These mobile apps like Revolut, N26 and Monzo, just to name a few, have hundreds of millions of euros in investor funding and are starting to chip away at the facade of traditional banking giants.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Leading the fintech scene<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Europe<\/strong> has been a hotbed of <a href=\"https:\/\/inside.vacuumlabs.com\/category\/fintech\">fintech<\/a> activity over the last decade and for many, is now considered to be the most developed of all fintech ecosystems, globally. Product advancements and a focus on regulation has made fintechs like Revolut, N26 and Monzo attractive to investors &#8211; whose large funding amounts have helped keep fintech activity alive in Europe, beating the US and Asia to the top investment spot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While much of the prominent and hyped-up fintech activity stems from the UK &#8211; which represents more than half of all mega deals in Europe over the past five years &#8211; others countries are driving fintech too and creating their own centres of activity, particularly in Lithuania, Estonia, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands.&nbsp;<br><br>Regulation and proximity to traditional financial services are the two main factors that influence the UK\u2019s fintech dominance. London is home to many of the big banks and financial organisations, meaning that they\u2019re only a quick tube ride away from the startup areas of the city.&nbsp;<br><br>The UK\u2019s FCA leads the way in terms of regulatory frameworks that appeal to startups, adding to the attractiveness of the UK for young companies. However, once you add Brexit into the mix, we may see the tides turning and the European fintech landscape changing dramatically. Research from think tank New Financial said that more than 275 firms in banking and finance have already moved to the EU away from the UK, with Dublin, Luxembourg, Paris and Frankfurt gaining the most so far. As the tale of Brexit continues, it opens the door to other parts of Europe, who are stepping up their game to make a welcoming home for fintechs.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>More than just payments<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019d be forgiven for mistaking that European fintech is just about mobile payments. While most (successful) European fintech companies operate in the payment sector \u2013 including the big players like Revolut, N26 and Monzo, that we\u2019ve mentioned, as well as TransferWise, Funding Circle and Klarna \u2013 the development of technology in Europe also supports the growth of niche markets, such as automated loans, robo-advisers and automated investment management.<br><br>The European Payment Services Directive (PSD2) \u2013 which regulates payment services and payment service providers throughout the EU and European Economic Area \u2013 has helped to define a stable regulatory environment and sparked the introduction of Open Banking. The use of open APIs will enable third-party access to data held by the traditional banking giants, meaning that fintech businesses can use the data to develop new products and services. Will this mean that we continue to see European fintech innovate in areas currently unavailable in the US?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/europeAsset-14-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1536\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Fintech in the US<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Fintech in the <strong>United States<\/strong> looks different to Europe partly due to its sheer size and scale. Once you add the diversity of financial institutions into the mix &#8211; from global banks to local, community banks &#8211; plus the added complication of the interaction between state and federal law; the US fintech scene is unique. If something is regulated at the state level, for example, this can lead to 50 different interpretations or sets of requirements for businesses to get their heads around.<br><br>As we\u2019ve seen, the European fintech scene is dominated by innovative payments businesses. Comparatively, the American mobile-payments industry is more than 50 times smaller than China\u2019s.<br><br>Many Americans still favour paying with physical dollar bills, as 30% of all consumer transactions are paid for in cash, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/the-economist-explains\/2018\/06\/26\/why-americans-are-warming-to-mobile-payments\">The Economist<\/a>. It\u2019s also surprising that the average American writes 38 cheques a year, given that the cheque is almost obsolete across Europe &#8211; this figure is nearly five times the number of the average Brit. This dependency on cash is reflected in the US fintech landscape and the products on offer \u2013 historically the US has dominated insurtech investment: the <a href=\"https:\/\/coverager.com\/2019-insurtech-investments-in-review\/\">top five insurtech investment<\/a> rounds in the US in 2019 average $405m; compared to $98m in Europe.<br><br>Some European startup founders have gone so far as to suggest that US companies could learn from Europe. But that hasn\u2019t stopped European neobanks for example, turning to the US, hoping to crack the retail banking market that is still dominated by traditional players.&nbsp;<br><br>Revolut, Monzo and N26 are all trying to break into the US market but have so far received a mixed response, citing issues such as regulation, apparent lack of demand and competition from existing banks. The difference in interchange fees in the UK compared to Europe is also a likely impact: banks\/neobanks can make money on interchange in the US but cannot in <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/IP_15_4585\">Europe<\/a>.&nbsp; Although things might be at a critical turning point, as N26 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2020\/01\/27\/n26-the-mobile-bank-backed-by-peter-thiel-has-gained-250000-us-users.html\">reported in January 2020<\/a> that they had attracted 250,000 users in the US and new customers are shifting funds from Chase and Citibank.<br><br>It\u2019s clear that European fintech innovation is influencing the way that financial institutions around the world are operating and will continue to do so. The current digital lag within the industry, due to the popularity of traditional payment methods, presents the ideal opportunity for European fintech players to get ahead of the curve.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"645\" height=\"646\" src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/usaAsset-9.png\" alt=\"fintech in the usa\" class=\"wp-image-1531\" srcset=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/usaAsset-9.png 645w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/usaAsset-9-300x300.png 300w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/usaAsset-9-150x150.png 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 645px) 100vw, 645px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>How about East?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The state of fintech in <strong>Asia Pacific<\/strong> is somewhat different from the US and Europe. According to data from CB Insights, Australia, Japan and Singapore have contributed more to the growth of fintech since 2018, while China continues to be at the forefront of APAC fintech development.<br><br>With flourishing investment and a loosening of regulation, Singapore is swiftly emerging as a Southeast Asian hub for fintech. There continues to be confidence in Singapore\u2019s fintech startup scene, despite trade tensions and global economic headwinds. Investment was up a massive 70% in 2019 from 2019, according to Accenture, crossing the SD$1 billion market.&nbsp;<br><br>We\u2019ve noted the rise of Challenger or Neobanks in Europe, but activity is also ramping up in Asian markets like South Korea, China and Southeast Asia. In Hong Kong especially, regulatory and infrastructure change is driving this activity; Singapore is also shaking up the banking sector. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mas.gov.sg\/news\/media-releases\/2019\/mas-to-issue-up-to-five-digital-bank-licences\">Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) announced in 2019<\/a> that virtual bank licenses would be issued as part of \u2018Singapore\u2019s liberalisation journey.\u2019<br><br>These new players in digital payments are naturally setting their sights beyond Singapore. The city-state is often used as the landing pad to launch businesses looking to expand into the regional ASEAN member states, where there is little in the way of traditional banking infrastructure such as ATMs and branches &#8211; almost three-quarters of the population does not have a bank account). They\u2019ll manage all the legal bits &#8211; getting their entity and intellectual property set up &#8211; from Singapore, before expanding their horizons. And with good reason, as the market for digital lending in ASEAN is fertile. The market is expected to more than quadruple to US$110 billion by 2025. Opportunities are abundant for many digital payments businesses.<br><br>One country ripe with opportunity is Indonesia &#8211; the largest internet economy in the region &#8211; which has more than quadrupled in size since 2015. Startups are capitalising on this opportunity. Some are following in the footsteps of China\u2019s \u201csuper-apps\u201d &#8211; like WeChat and Alipay, both of which first found market success in verticals that have nothing to do with financial services (social media and e-commerce, respectively) &#8211; and have expanded to provide financial services to consumers and businesses.&nbsp;<br><br>Indonesia\u2019s ride-hailing giant Go-Jek started out as a transportation and delivery company (think Uber), and has since expanded into payments. Its mobile wallet, Go-Pay, saw transaction volumes of $6.3 billion in 2018 and is used by over 240,000 online and offline merchants across Indonesia, according to research from <a href=\"https:\/\/newsroom.mastercard.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Start-Path-_-CB-Insights-2020-Trends-Report_FINAL.pdf\">CB Insights<\/a>.<br><br>This competition in APAC has largely been welcomed as it would create the motivation for traditional banks to do more with technology and provide better services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"646\" height=\"645\" src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/asiaAsset-16.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1542\" srcset=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/asiaAsset-16.png 646w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/asiaAsset-16-300x300.png 300w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/asiaAsset-16-150x150.png 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 646px) 100vw, 646px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Strong investment in LatAm<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Fintech isn\u2019t just specific to the hotspots in the US, Europe and APAC; there is activity across the rest of the world too. There are several emerging leading startups in <strong>Latin America<\/strong>, with Mexico in particular is a hotbed for fintech investment and activity. Many fintech startups in LatAm are focused on lending to underserved consumers and SMBs, with some countries in the region lacking developed financial infrastructure and facing political unrest.<br><br>For example, Brazil-based Creditas is a digital lending platform for consumers, that funds customer loans through both investors and financial institutions. Core products include a version of home equity and auto loans, in which borrowers offer residences or vehicles as collateral for first-lien lending products.<br><br>Regulations across the region are fragmented, with variation and different stances taken in each country &#8211; often making it difficult for startups to base themselves in one country, and expand their business from there, like many are doing from Singapore to extend into the rest of APAC. Yet there is progress. For instance, Mexico has been proactive in its regulatory standing and guidelines for FinTech companies, along with launching a regulatory sandbox in March 2018. Brazil is also making moves, establishing regulations in April 2018 to allow fintech firms to provide P2P services.<br><br>Regulators on the whole may have been slow to respond in Latin America, but investment is strong. Looking forward, there is no reason why startups across Latin America wouldn\u2019t continue to flourish, in spite of instability and spare regulatory guidance.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/latin-americaAsset-12-1.png\" alt=\"fintech latin america\" class=\"wp-image-1533\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>No pushback in Africa<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In <strong>Africa<\/strong>, many startups are leapfrogging legacy architecture, building mobile-first payment applications for parts of the population that don\u2019t have access to traditional financial services. M-PESA, the mobile payments platform, has been operating in Africa since 2007 and is considered as one of the original fintech innovations. It is perhaps the most striking example of leveraging vast and growing mobile penetration in the region.<br><br>Payments has long been a trend to watch in African fintech, and continues to be so. Startups, such as Nigeria-based OPay &#8211; a one-stop mobile-based platform for payment, transportation, food and grocery delivery &#8211; are increasingly building out mobile wallets and payment processing platforms, testing whether mobile money can serve as a catalyst for financial inclusion.&nbsp;<br><br>If we look at regulation in Africa and compared to the rest of the world, startups are largely able to work without much pushback. CB Insights\u2019 2020 Trends Report suggests that this is predominantly because African fintech startups are bringing hundreds of millions of people into the financial system, while legacy banks primarily continue to cater to the continent\u2019s wealthiest.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/africaAsset-10-1.png\" alt=\"fintech battlegrounds\" class=\"wp-image-1534\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What will the next decade look like?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Fintech will look very different in the next 10 years. Regions will continue watching and learning from each other, and businesses will always want to expand their reach to become a part of everyday life for as many consumers as possible.

Cristina founded her company after seeing how painful managing software-as-a-service subscriptions were for other founders and their CFOs. Cledara empowers companies to manage all their subscriptions in one place, track budgets, and have all invoices in one place.<br><br>We spoke about how the company got started and how she managed to build her very own &#8220;Friends of Cledara&#8221; community very early on. They helped her build the first minimum viable product, win &#8220;Best SaaS Startup of the Year&#8221; at SaaStock 2018 and then raise capital from Anthemis and BBVA. Thus, she could continue her journey and open up new opportunities.

One search for <em>Tribalism<\/em> and you are immediately pushed to think about how we are destroying society by joining these Political Tribes, and that\u2019s a shame. Tribalism is on the rise, and this is not a bad thing.<br><br>One could even say, in a world in which populism and political tribalism reigns supreme, the mini-tribes that we have become so accustomed to in the past ten years, are helping us cope.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A contemporary view on tribalism<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When I think about the person I was 10 years ago, I feel like I belonged to a bit of everything. My group of friends was numbered in the dozens, a mix of groups like university, high school, field hockey, bars, work, bars, travel folks. My taste in music was everything from 90s rap to Icelandic classical. I ate meat, fish, chicken, vegetables, and fruit. I would fly on any airline.&nbsp; I would watch any type of sport. Back then, I was using Whatsapp mostly to send my parents the occasional message. There was no Slack. Meetups weren\u2019t really a thing. Facebook was dominant, and although I belonged to a few groups, this was just to show my interests to others.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/team-of-business-people-using-mobile-phone-A93QZG7-1187x791.jpg\" alt=\"business tribalism\" class=\"wp-image-1512\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now in 2020, I feel as though I belong very strongly to a few things. I belong to a number of subsets in the Fintech Community. I go to the same bar in Berlin to watch Liverpool play (FC Magnet for all you folks who find yourself in Berlin for a Reds game), and know exactly where my crew will be sitting. I practice a very specific form of yoga 4 times a week, and sweat and support the same group of yogis every morning. I now only have three groups of friends: a small group of London girls, my core friends in Berlin, and my 5 friends I grew up with. <br><br>Now when I go to concerts, they are either nostalgic bands from the 90s, or strictly classical music. I no longer eat meat, and really only go to a few restaurants (and of course, I go to each with a different crew).<br><br>So what\u2019s the difference? Why do I feel that today, I have these loyal mini-tribes? Why do I feel that my life is way more concentrated? What has changed in the last 10 years? Two things jump out at me to explain this: the way technology has changed the way we assimilate and communicate with each other and the sheer increase in consumer choice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Technology<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Technology has changed the way I am connected to people.&nbsp; In one day I can have virtual meetings with colleagues in California, speak to a supplier in Singapore and then interview a customer in Slovakia. I talk to my boyfriend on WhatsApp while flying at 30,000 feet on business trips. We can speak to anyone, anytime, and anywhere with the mass adoption of Whatsapp and Slack. The latter has been at the forefront of creating mini-tribes. Here are just a few examples of my Whatsapp Groups (no judgement please):<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>WhatsApp<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Shovel Town (my girlfriends I grew up with)<\/li><li>AYS Mysore (Mysore yoga students at an Ashtanga Shala in Berlin)<\/li><li>Part Deux (London girlfriends)<\/li><li>Fucked off with Fintech (Female Fintechers)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Slack: Within my members-only coworking space<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Designers Circle<\/li><li>Fintech Circle<\/li><li>Women&#8217;s Circle<\/li><li>Designers Circle <\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Social media and messaging have made it literally a few click journey to join both a highly-niche tribe, and as many tribes of people with similar interests all around the world. This, combined with the fact that the world is constantly online, people are responding in real-time, constantly informing others of their movements, thoughts, pain, and concerns, has created a whole new wave of tribalism. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/annie-spratt-dWYU3i-mqEo-unsplash-1186x791.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1516\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Pure choice<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Today I am spoiled for choice in almost every aspect of my life. Thinking about the choice in relation to food, society today allows us to be very picky eaters. Ten years ago I practiced on and off vegetarian. The off-time was when it was just too difficult or time-consuming to find a vegetarian alternative that wasn\u2019t a dull pasta or a bland salad. Today, I am a pescitarian, with so many choices of what to eat, where to eat and how to eat. Think about all the pop-up restaurants, the vegan-only cafes, the vegan only-gluten free-Asian cafes, the soughdough only pizza stalls. The choice is vast.&nbsp;<br><br>The closest restaurant to my apartment is a hummus shack. I literally mean shack. It\u2019s owned by an Israeli who is also the chef, waiter, and chief comedian. He only makes hummus (and it\u2019s damn good), but also prides himself on bringing together the hummus lovers all over Berlin. In the hummus shack, you talk to people, you exchange numbers, you find people with similar interests. Most of the folks are regulars, forming one of probably a few different hummus tribes in Berlin.&nbsp;<br><br>Belonging to tribes is nothing new. It is actually far from something new. However, what is new is the fact that we can be part of many tribes. What\u2019s also new is the breadth of tribes available to us, driven by the fact we live in a world where we are spoiled for choice.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Photo-by-Daniel-Lincoln-on-Unsplash-633x791.jpg\" alt=\"Tribalism\" class=\"wp-image-1348\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>The tribal revolution<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We are in the midst of a tribalism revolution. Way back in our cave-dwelling days we formed these tribes based on need \u2014 a need to outwit nature, a need to protect our beliefs, and our inherent need to connect. Today, we are joining tribes, and many of them, because we want to and because we can.&nbsp;<br><br>So where does <a href=\"https:\/\/inside.vacuumlabs.com\/fintech\/theres-a-bank-for-that\">banking<\/a> fit into this?<br><br>As I write this in 2020, it feels as though I can call upon a tribe in almost any area of my life. Eating, exercising, innovating, fashion, travelling. But, there is one area which I feel like I really have no tribe:&nbsp; My financial life (yes, I am aware of the crypto community but for the sake of time I will not go down that rabbit hole).  I am still the customer of a neo-bank with 5 million customers. I use an investment platform that is available to literally any type of investor. There is no way I can share and blend my financial life with my tribe members.<br><br>The biggest challenge I face in my financial life is obtaining a mortgage in Germany. As a freelancer, it is difficult (difficult may actually be an understatement) to get a mortgage if you have been freelancing for under three years. The banks require my income tax statements, which tend to be submitted 6-12 months after the year end, making the timeframe even longer. There are rarely any exceptions. I am extremely confident that my income from freelancing would easily qualify me for a mortgage here, given the property prices in Berlin. I feel as though I am missing out on the opportunity to purchase a flat in the city I love because there is no financial institution that supports the freelancer tribe.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/blake-wisz-tE6th1h6Bfk-unsplash-1186x791.jpg\" alt=\"person paying\" class=\"wp-image-1510\"\/><figcaption>Photo by Blake Wisz on Unsplash<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Thinking about my other tribes, what would a bank focusing on yogis look like? How could this tie together my financial health with my actual health? What about a bank for Liverpool fans? Cashback towards merchandise, premium access based on premium cards?<br><br>These are only a handful of examples of where a bank, or financial institution that focussed on a tribe could make my life easier. In a world where we join more and more tribes, our profile as a customer will change also. We have experienced digital revolutions in banking, insurance, accommodation, and transportation. Our new wave of tribalism is a good thing.&nbsp;<br><br>We can lean on our tribes for support no matter where we or they are in the world. We can obtain support in real-time. We can learn and thrive in the new wave of tribalism. Who we are as customers is changing, and tribalism will be at the heart of this. It\u2019s about time we kick start the customer segmentation revolution and launch tailored, relevant, supportive solutions that support the heart of the many tribes out there from sports teams, to gig-workers, to yogis. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Repeat after me: Tribalism is not bad<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":13,"featured_media":1513,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":""},"categories":[13],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v16.4 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>The Rise of the Tribe and the Role of the Bank: The Tribal Banking Manifesto - Vacuumlabs<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"We are in the midst of a tribalism revolution.

Now digital payments have blown up in volume and gone global. According to<a href=\"https:\/\/worldpaymentsreport.com\/\"> <\/a><em><a href=\"https:\/\/worldpaymentsreport.com\/\">The World Payments Report 2019<\/a><\/em>, global non-cash transactions reached 539 billion during 2016-17 and are expected to have a compound annual growth rate of 14% between 2017 and 2022.&nbsp;<br><br>The payments landscape is evolving rapidly. Customers are demanding instant payments that are integrated within their online experience and technology is enabling increasingly innovative ways of making payments. A key concern felt by many payments customers is just how to ensure their data and money is safe at all times.&nbsp; <br><br>As the volume and speed of payments has increased, security measures have evolved with the times. The traditional password is no longer a challenge to hackers and financial institutions have attempted to stay a step ahead with more robust authentication measures such as multi-step authentication and PINs. These methods have enhanced security but inconvenienced the customer.&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Biometrics as the seamless security solution <\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Biometrics involves the use of voice recognition, facial scans and in some cases iris recognition technologies to provide tougher security protection to customers and make life harder for fraudsters.<br><br>These technologies are part of day-to-day life for most smartphone users, seamlessly integrated into sign-on processes and they are particularly welcomed by Generation Z, who were born in the digital age of 1995 onwards.  &nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1709\" src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/hand-using-smartphone-with-blank-mock-up-screen-72JW6E9-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1489\" srcset=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/hand-using-smartphone-with-blank-mock-up-screen-72JW6E9-scaled.jpg 2560w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/hand-using-smartphone-with-blank-mock-up-screen-72JW6E9-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/hand-using-smartphone-with-blank-mock-up-screen-72JW6E9-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/hand-using-smartphone-with-blank-mock-up-screen-72JW6E9-768x513.jpg 768w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/hand-using-smartphone-with-blank-mock-up-screen-72JW6E9-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/hand-using-smartphone-with-blank-mock-up-screen-72JW6E9-2048x1367.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><br>This generation are estimated to become 40% of all consumers in 2020 so their needs are increasingly influential in the payments landscape. Growing up in the era of Apple and Facebook, they are more cautious around online security than might be expected. Generation Z expect their financial providers to use the best security that technology can provide and they are comfortable using secure biometric technologies when making payments. <br><br>One payment provider that has taken security considerations to the next level is <a href=\"https:\/\/twistopay.com\/cz\/\">Twisto<\/a>. We worked with them to create instant credit at point-of-sale for consumers in Central and Eastern Europe, which has been welcomed by customers with little credit history and by merchants who have enjoyed more sales and increased order sizes.

Simple branded things such as pens or towels are not something that would fulfil these requirements. <br><br>We approached this problem from a different perspective and decided to please our colleagues by showing them that the gift they receive carries Vacuumlabs\u2019 values and actually helps others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/tomcleAsset-4-1296x610.png\" alt=\"gift cooperation\" class=\"wp-image-1445\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is the message of a gift?&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the modern age, it becomes harder and harder to create a gift that stands out. A good start is, therefore, to think about the message of a gift. We give it to others because we want them to smile, bring them happiness, ease their life or motivate them to do something they wish to do. Our idea was to express our values in a real-life form rather than stamp some random things with our logo.<br><br>A true Vacuumlabs\u2019 team member can work from anywhere in the world and helps those who need it. Drawing on the former, we started to think about a gift that would encourage our colleagues to travel and explore the cities where we have offices. We also wanted to donate part of the budget to those who need it, as a way of supporting <a href=\"https:\/\/inside.vacuumlabs.com\/category\/community\">society<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/36798499_1083040475181238_1221683926720839680_o-1186x791.jpg\" alt=\"Maty\" class=\"wp-image-1443\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Avoid being self-centric but retain the gift value&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can be the kindest person in the world but your gift will always be constrained by a certain budget. That especially applies if a part of the budget is to be donated, as it directly decreases the physical value of the gift. But in reality, the value of the gift increases if it has a message. It&#8217;s important, therefore, to ask yourself two questions to avoid donating the whole budget:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Can you afford such a donation? <\/li><li>Is it going to affect the gift itself?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The next step is to choose someone who will really benefit from the donation, and to not ruin yourself financially.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Support someone with ambition<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We came across Maty, an ambitious young boy with Asperger\u2019s syndrome who draws city transportation maps. He then designs t-shirts, shoes, backpacks and other things using his maps and sells them through his project <a href=\"http:\/\/maappi.com\/\">Maappi<\/a>. Maty donates part of his profits to other children with Asperger\u2019s and raises awareness about his condition, as well as the conditions of others. He dreams that one day, people in Prague will wear his products.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/bratislava-fin-725x791.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1447\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We immediately fell in love with Maty and his project, and came up with an idea to connect our values with his designs. What kind of gift would connect those ideas together? We needed to answer this question so we called our colleagues for help.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Include colleagues in the creation process<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When brainstorming the gift, more people means more brainpower. It also makes other colleagues feel good if they participate in the process and add their insight into the gift creation. Everyone\u2019s input is useful. Colleagues from other teams also see challenges the firm faces from many different perspectives. For example, they can gather feedback from team members if they desire fancy slippers, a creative branded hoodie or, perhaps, a quality course.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/xmas-BA-30-1-1185x791.jpg\" alt=\"wanderer's gift pack\" class=\"wp-image-1446\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Wanderer\u2019s pack<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Combining the steps, we came up with an idea to create a pack that would carry our values and also help Maty with his project Maappi. To support our colleagues\u2019 travel between our offices, we collaborated with Maty and put his beautiful maps on five unique backpacks: one for each city where we have an office. On top of that, we added a guide with interesting places in every city, compiled by colleagues from all five offices across the countries. We asked everyone to participate in the process and hand us their tips. Also, each recipient found a thermos to keep drinks warm on their travels.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-facebook wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-facebook\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"fb-video\" data-allowfullscreen=\"true\" data-href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/587979361266879\/videos\/2577908642498524\/\"><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We also donated part of the budget to Maty. Together with other donations and his profits, he managed to raise enough money to open his branded shop in Prague and sell his products in the offline store. We are thrilled that we helped him in making this huge step and that we spread the idea through more than 200 Wanderers\u2019 packs that our Vacuumlabs team now proudly uses.<br><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How to bring joy into the team with a gift<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":7,"featured_media":1458,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":""},"categories":[16],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v16.4 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Can a company gift help thousands of children? - Vacuumlabs<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"When thinking about a company gift, Internal Marketing and HR teams often have to solve many problems at once.

While we could complain about why God is playing real-life <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/technology-51673293\">Plague Inc.<\/a> on Casual mode, let\u2019s instead think about how to spend the days during home office more productively. Working remotely brings a lot of distractions that might not be at the <a href=\"https:\/\/inside.vacuumlabs.com\/community\/step-inside-vacuumlabs-home-in-kosice\">office<\/a>.&nbsp;<br><br>So let\u2019s break down the best seven practices on increasing your productivity when working at the most distracting place in the world &#8211; your own home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1. Prepare your home office for productivity<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Why do we study at the library, even if we don\u2019t want to? It\u2019s the environment that influences us! You\u2019ll surely be distracted if you don\u2019t set up your home-office working place for the actual work. A high-traffic room is probably not the best idea, so pick a room with the least amount of distractions that you can. Find a quiet place, preferably with a window and a nice desk. Make sure that you keep all the things that distract you away from you.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Photo-by-Huseyn-Kamaladdin-from-Pexels-1024x709.jpg\" alt=\"home office\" class=\"wp-image-1320\"\/><figcaption>Photo by Huseyn Kamaladdin from Pexels<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Turn on Do Not Disturb mode<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While this might apply to office work as well, turning off your notifications will undoubtedly boost your home office productivity. Checking your phone for the latest news or replying to messages will result in zero work done. Remember, it can take only one notification that will break your productivity flow.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3. Start a Pomodoro timer and take (eye) breaks<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you go for a coffee break, meeting, 1on1 or lunch at work, you also keep your brain refreshed. Arrange yourself a good productivity timer such as <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pomodoro_Technique\">the Pomodoro technique<\/a>. A Pomodoro block usually consists of 25 minutes of work followed by a short five-minute break. This repeats 4 times, after that, you take a longer 15-minute break. If you catch a productivity flow, feel free to carry on working without stopping. During breaks, reward yourself to increase concentration and focus on major tasks. Also, don\u2019t forget to take breaks to reduce eye strain \u2013&nbsp;20-20-20 rule is a fine start. You can practice it by looking at something 20 metres away and closing your eyes for 20 seconds and repeating every 20 minutes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Photo-by-Ken-Tomita-from-Pexels-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"home office workstation\" class=\"wp-image-1321\"\/><figcaption>Photo by Ken Tomita from Pexels<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>4. Clean your home office workspace<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s right, get rid of the clutter. Books, papers, pens, food \u2013 whatever is stuck at your home office station should be unmercifully cleaned up. Maintain a high standard of cleanliness at your desk to keep help you focus on what\u2019s on the screen.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5. Prepare your Asana (and other apps too)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Communication with your colleagues needs to go strictly digital when working at home. That way, your task-management and communication tools such as Asana and Slack (or any other productivity apps) will be even more crucial for you. And it\u2019s not only about communication. Keeping your Asana list close and open also reminds you about your most important tasks, so seeing your deadlines will actually help you work more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/homeoffice-49v8tn-e1583939065130.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1322\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>6. Put a \u26d4\ufe0f sign on the door<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You surely know those people too. Those who don\u2019t understand that working at home is still working. It doesn\u2019t mean you can go wash the dishes, repair something at your bathroom or, perhaps,&nbsp; go shopping whenever you want. Establish your home office hours, inform your loved ones and friends, and put a Do Not Disturb sign on the door so everyone knows you\u2019re unapproachable. Unleash the creative monster in you and make a funny N\/A sign for you and your team members. Inspire <a href=\"https:\/\/luxafor.com\/12-clever-and-funny-do-not-disturb-door-sign-ideas-for-office-that-actually-work\/\">here<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>7. Proper home office planning does good work<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you start doing anything, prepare a list of tasks you\u2019re going to work on and schedule your day. Since you work from home, you can arrange your home office hours to completely fit your needs. Use the flexibility that remote work gives you to allocate time for \u201cbeing in the zone\u201d, virtual meetings and calls more efficiently. For example, you can do some deep work in the morning while others sleep and take calls in the afternoon.

Teams can participate either remotely or come to one of the official Google Hubs to enjoy the competitiveness of other teams present and have fun afterwards. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/834768053706778\/\">One of only two official hubs<\/a> in Slovakia is our HQ in Bratislava.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>You will solve an optimization problem<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>&#8220;The event starts with a live stream, where people from Google define the challenge of the Google Hash Code Qualification Round. In the past, those tasks included, for example, deliveries by drones,&nbsp; the optimization of video cache for YouTube or an autonomous taxi service.&#8221; <\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Says Andy Skok, Senior Software Developer at Vacuumlabs, and the organizer of Bratislava&#8217;s hubs in the past few years. <br><br>At the start, developers will see the optimization problems and around five outputs for testing their solutions in the online environment. The total possible points scored will be, as every year, included in the problem description.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Let&#8217;s get to Hash Code tips for competing<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. The more problems you solve, the more points you get. <\/strong>You can expect standard inputs, but also some extreme cases. Your algorithm should work for a variety of data.<br><br><strong>2. Choose your language wisely.<\/strong> While you do upload your code, it&#8217;s not actually run. In reality, only output files are checked.<br><br><strong>3. Work your ass off until the last second.<\/strong> Every solution is graded, but you only get points for the best one.<br><br><strong>4. Networking and competitiveness in the hub create an invaluable atmosphere.<\/strong> On top of that, you can work with different approaches with other teams and discover various points of view.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>5<\/strong>. Use the <strong>help of &#8220;non-programmers&#8221;<\/strong>. Andy Skok remembers: <strong>&#8220;Last year, our colleague Martina from the Finance Department came to support us, and after a few minutes she helped us with her Excel and output skills. It&#8217;s essential to keep smart people around you. They don&#8217;t necessarily have to be devs.&#8221;<\/strong><br><br><strong>6. Check the preliminary results and motivate yourself. <\/strong>The leaderboard is public for the first two hours, which improves performance. Afterwards, the standings freeze to create some tension.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>7. Create a good overview of optimization algorithms. <\/strong>You will hardly make it to the top 100 without knowing simulated annealing, genetic or evolutionary algorithms.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>8<\/strong>. There&#8217;s beauty in simplicity and often even the best solution.<strong> &#8220;It often happens that overthinking leads to the solution nobody understands. Such an answer receives fewer points than a simple idea with small upgrades,&#8221;<\/strong> advises Andy Skok.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/DSC_8566-1024x684.jpg\" alt=\"Hash Code solver Andy Skok\" class=\"wp-image-1299\"\/><figcaption>Andy Skok of Vacuumlabs<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Google Hash Code 2020 starts in a few days, so don&#8217;t waste a minute and join thousands of developers in this prestigious challenge. <a href=\"https:\/\/hashcode.withgoogle.com\/\">Registration<\/a> for hub competitions closes on 17th February. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Thousands of devs solve Google Hash Code each year.

In this article, we will take a closer look at the very foundation of the banking stack &#8211; the core.<br><br>Gartner defines core banking as a \u2018back-end system that processes daily banking transactions and posts updates to accounts and other financial records. Core banking systems typically include deposit, loan and credit processing capabilities, with interfaces to general ledger systems and reporting tools\u2019.<br><br>From a tech perspective, core banking would typically be composed of (relatively) simple transaction and balance holding systems.&nbsp;<br><br>What typically causes the incredible complexity in banking is the interconnectedness of these systems within legacy system architectures which have been incrementally layered upon over years and years of their service.<br><br>Core banking replacement projects can take literally years, even in mid-sized banks. This is due to the direct or indirect implication on almost every system, business or reporting process and in the end, on the customer journeys too.<br><br>To no one\u2019s surprise, the incumbents usually treat these back-end systems in an <em>\u2018if it is not broken, don\u2019t fix it\u2019<\/em> manner, especially considering the expense and risk related to replacing core banking systems while.<br><br>Decades-old technology plagues this part of banking stack hidden for from the executive and customer view. It is no wonder that in this part of the banking world, COBOL, a programming language originally invented in 1959 is still a force to consider. Reuters has reported that COBOL-based systems working say that 95% of ATM transactions pass through COBOL programs, 80% of in-person transactions rely on them, and over 40% of banks still use COBOL as the foundational technology of their systems. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Tide Is Changing<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter the new wave of financial services. Beyond the customer-facing businesses such as Revolut or Monzo lies a layer of innovation that uproots the very basis of legacy banking. New core banking platforms built with no technology debt and architecture which responds to the age of digital-first, cloud-based and super-agile businesses.<br><br>Let\u2019s explore some of these players now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Thought Machine<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Set up in London in 2014 by Paul Taylor, Thought Machine is boldly claiming to be building technology to revolutionize banking with a heavy-hitting tech team &#8211;&nbsp; their CEO, CTO, CIO, and COO are all former Google engineers. In October 2019, Thought Machine made it to Fintech 50 \u2013 an annual ranking of the hottest fintech startups in Europe amongst the likes of Monzo or Revolut.<br><br>Thought Machine scored Lloyds Banking Group as one of the lead investors in their Series A financing round &#8211; with Lloyd acquiring a 10% stake in the fintech for an \u00a311m investment. In terms of customers, it has recently announced partnerships with the likes of IBM and challenger Atom Bank.<br><br>At the core of Thought Machine\u2019s offering sits Vault, a core banking platform designed and written from the scratch, driven by microservice API architecture and native to the cloud.<br><br>This is how Thought Machine describes their engine: \u201cVault can run any type of banking product, from mortgages to current accounts. It has a workflow engine which defines how the bank operates. All data runs in real time within the system, meaning data analytics and regulatory reporting can be fully automated. Customer Apps and APIs create the ability to have fully automated customer interaction.\u201d<br><br>This Google-like approach to banking is heavily reliant on cloud, enabling quick deployment and horizontal scaling. At the very heart of Vault lie immutable ledgers which hold the single source of truth of any bank instance.&nbsp;<br><br>These ledgers include a transactional database and then something dubbed \u2018smart contracts\u2019. Not to be mistaken with the Ethereum implementation, in Thought Machine semantics smart contracts are a way to implement the product logic &#8211; from current account to a credit card &#8211; into their system. These contracts hold both the legal side of the contract and product servicing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/thought_machine-1024x531.png\" alt=\"though machine banking revolution\" class=\"wp-image-1167\"\/><figcaption>Thought Machine <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thoughtmachine.net\/\">Website<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Mambu<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Founded in 2011 and hailing from Berlin, Mambu is one of the original core banking tech innovators. Among its current customers, you can find household fintech names such as N26 or a SME lender Oaknorth, but also legacy players such as ABM Amro.<br><br>At the heart of their offering lies a cloud platform for banks and lenders which optimizes for speed, agility and \u2018puts customer relationships\u2019 first. What does that mean in terms of the technology? At core of Mambu&#8217;s offering there are two core pieces at play:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>The Cloud Banking Engine<\/strong> is the cloud-based platform enabling account origination, lending, deposits and associated transaction with an exposed API<\/li><li><strong>The Process Orchestrator<\/strong> empowers banks to quickly integrate or \u2018compose\u2019 their IT landscape with integrations and business processes, delivered as-a-service<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/mambu_architecture-1024x725.png\" alt=\"core banking infographic\" class=\"wp-image-1145\"\/><figcaption>Mambu Architecture (source: <a href=\"https:\/\/cdn.sanity.io\/files\/0k2k2bbv\/production\/5019753fe5e8c59a89198c60f175c2efaa961716.pdf\">Introduction to Composable Banking whitepaper<\/a>)<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Mambu packs all of this under the premise of composable banking. According to Mambu, composable banking is an <em>\u201capproach to the design and delivery of financial services based on the rapid and flexible assembly of independent, best-for-purpose systems. Instead of locking these functions together for dedicated applications and workflows, composable banking separates the functions so they can be combined and recombined in new ways to deliver new services and customer experiences.\u201d<\/em><br><br>In other words &#8211; banking stack composed of self-contained components which can be mixed and matched, are scalable and connectable via APIs, deployed in cloud and natively supporting lean delivery of new customer experiences.&nbsp;<br><br>We are of course only dabbing at the surface of the technology here &#8211; for more information take a look at Mambu\u2019s composable banking <a href=\"https:\/\/cdn.sanity.io\/files\/0k2k2bbv\/production\/5019753fe5e8c59a89198c60f175c2efaa961716.pdf\">whitepaper<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Five Degrees<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Founded in 2009, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fivedegrees.com\/\">Five Degrees<\/a> hails from The Netherlands. The company offers two clearly separable products.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Matrix Mid<\/strong> As the same suggests, this is a product for banks with legacy systems which are not looking to replace all of their stack. Instead, it serves as a middleware option which can integrate with any legacy core banking. The key selling point here is that it enables banks to create a holistic view of a customer by separating customer data and interactions from everything else. Why is this important? By taking control of <em>\u2018onboarding, transactions, documents, and all customer interactions\u2019<\/em> the banks can offer a more personalized and tailored customer experiences and journeys. In addition, this technology layer is built with open banking in mind, helping banks to comply with regulations such as PSD-2 and more easily open up to a fintech ecosystem.<\/li><li><strong>Matrix Accounts<\/strong> is the end-to-end core banking platforms that enables issuing a suite of core banking products including single and multi-currency cash accounts, term deposits and loans. The platform also supports payments functionality \u2018out of box\u2019 such as SEPA, SWIFT and internal payments. Similarly to Mambu and Thought Machine, the platform is built with modern tech principles in mind, based on micro-services architecture and highly componental.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Who Is This For?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The three players we shortly introduced have a fair amount of commonalities, at least when it comes to the first principles of the technology architecture. Cloud-based and continuous deployment, microservices, self-contained components and exposed APIs are just a few key principles they abide by.&nbsp;<br><br>Who are the target customers for these new technologies?<br><br>For incumbent banks, the underlying issue is the sheer complexity of replacing the core banking from the ground up. This is where solutions such as Five Degrees\u2019 Mid Matrix might provide the best effort to value in the short-term for their core business. There are parts of&nbsp;their business &#8211; such as launching a new brand or business line where even incumbents can take advantage of. ABN-AMRO is a fitting case in point here. The bank has utilized Mambu to launch new10, an SME banking proposition in the Dutch market and Five Degrees\u2019 technology to launch Kendu, a retail investment app.<br><br>On the other side of the spectrum, some of the top tier of fintech unicorns with significant amount of resources at their disposal (such as Monzo and Revolut)&nbsp; opt to build out these systems from scratch and in a proprietary way.&nbsp;<br><br>Most new players to the fintech and banking world with an ambition to launch a banking product are truly the sweet spot. An investment to develop a core banking system from zero simply does not make sense. Vendors such as Mambu, Thought Machine and Five Degrees are welcome news as they provide another point of opportunity to leapfrog the incumbents and challenge the status quo of financial services.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Exploring new paradigms of core banking technology<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":8,"featured_media":1134,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":""},"categories":[13],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v16.4 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>The Mysterious World of Core Banking - Vacuumlabs<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"In the next part of the series, Matej Ftacnik is exploring new paradigms of core banking technology.

And the app was packed with features \u2014 such as auto-saving and spending limits \u2014 designed to address younger consumers\u2019 financial challenges and expectations.&nbsp;<br><br>As Chase\u2019s CEO of Digital Bill Wallace <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20171023005659\/en\/Meet-Finn-Chase%E2%80%99s-New-Bank-App\">explained it<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201c<em>When it comes to money, millennials told us they don\u2019t want to feel like they\u2019re being judged. So, we designed Finn to put them in charge, no matter where or how they\u2019re spending<\/em>.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Sadly, Chase\u2019s gamble didn\u2019t succeed, mainly because it did not seem to offer any value proposition they could not get elsewhere.<br><br>Over 18 months, it acquired a mere 47,000 customers \u2014 in comparison, market leader Ally had 1.5 million. As a result, Chase announced it would be shutting it down in 2019.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Sni\u0301mka-obrazovky-2019-11-02-o-14.54.36.png\" alt=\"banks try to innovate, Finn by Chase\" class=\"wp-image-1027\"\/><figcaption>Finn by Chase<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But while Chase\u2019s foray into mobile-first banking didn\u2019t deliver the results they were hoping for, this hasn\u2019t stopped other traditional banks from launching their own digital offshoots.&nbsp;<br><br>If anything, this strategy is increasingly becoming the norm. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>From challengers to challenged<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Banks may be thought of as laggards in today\u2019s fintech world. But throughout their history, they\u2019ve been at the forefront of technological innovation. Barclays made banking location-independent in 1967, when it launched the first ATM. And the Nottingham Building Society ushered in the era of online banking in 1983 with Homelink, a system that was so advanced it even let customers compare prices and shop online.<br><br>This all changed when Lehman Brothers crashed in September 2008.&nbsp;Having been blamed for the biggest recession since the Great Depression of 1929, banks spent the latter part of the 2000s and the first half of the 2010s dealing with the fallout. And this meant innovation had to be put on the back burner. <br><br>In the meantime, the proliferation of smartphones and continuous simplification of the regulatory environment allowed technology companies to enter and disrupt the market in a profound fashion. By the mid-2010s, the likes of Monzo, Revolut, and N26 had won over millions of customers and achieved unicorn status.<br><br>More to the point, customer expectations had shifted. Where many traditional banks still relied on outdated processes and systems, neo-banks kept setting the bar higher and higher, making banking faster, simpler, more convenient, and <a href=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/blog\/there-is-a-bank-for-that\">more personal<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hitting the mainstream<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to research by Accenture, challenger banks will have 35 million customers in 2020 \u2014 triple the amount of customers they have today. Meanwhile, banks will be growing their customer base by less than 1%. <br><br>1 in 4 people under 37 now uses a challenger bank. And the lure of mobile-first isn\u2019t attracting only Millennials. 14% of consumers across all age groups \u2014 yes, including Baby Boomers \u2014 have at least one mobile only-provider. The unicorns have shown customers a new, better way to bank, and a growing number of consumers are loving it. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Reinventing traditional banking<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With challenger banks\u2019 star on the rise, traditional banks have an existential choice to make \u2014 adapt or face irrelevance. Citi\u2019s CEO for global consumer banking Stephen Bird <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2018\/11\/01\/fintech-banks-face-extinction-phase-amid-new-financial-technology.html\">puts it in these terms<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201c<em>We think of it as we are living through an extinction phase. It\u2019s not an incremental thing, it\u2019s an epochal shift<\/em>.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>More and more banks are waking up to this. But they\u2019re not reacting by changing themselves from within. Instead, they\u2019re opting to <a href=\"https:\/\/inside.vacuumlabs.com\/fintech\/one-provider-to-build-it-all\">create<\/a> separate, stand-alone initiatives in a bid to outperform the challengers.<br><br>Let\u2019s have a look at some of the mobile-first products banks have created and discuss how they\u2019re pushing the envelope. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mettle<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Owned by NatWest, Mettle bills itself as \u201c<em>the business account that helps you get ahead today<\/em>.\u201d&nbsp;<br><br>Sole traders and limited companies can open an account in minutes by downloading the Mettle app. But what sets it apart from a traditional business bank account are features such as invoicing, bookkeeping, payment tracking and performance forecasting, which are designed to help small businesses take control of their finances more generally.&nbsp;<br><br>NatWest\u2019s Chief Executive of Commercial and Private Banking Alison Rose <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rbs.com\/rbs\/news\/2018\/11\/natwest-launches-innovative-digital-proposition-for-smes.html\">explains it this way<\/a>:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201c<em>The premise for Mettle lets our customers focus on \u2018forward-looking\u2019 finances, combining technology and proactive insights so SMEs can make better decisions and run their businesses more successfully<\/em>.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Mettle isn\u2019t an original concept. Another UK-based startup, Coconut, also offers business accounts that let sole traders and limited companies invoice, categorize expenses automatically, and even calculate how much tax is due in real-time.&nbsp;<br><br>But while, as a startup, Coconut has had to monetize, NatWest\u2019s status as one of the Big 5 UK banks allows them to offer Mettle\u2019s full set of features for free. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Sni\u0301mka-obrazovky-2019-11-02-o-14.57.01-1.png\" alt=\"Mettle by NatWest, banks create spin-offs\" class=\"wp-image-1030\"\/><figcaption>Mettle by RBS Presentation<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Marcus<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Launched by Goldman Sachs in 2016, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marcus.co.uk\/uk\/en\">Marcus<\/a> offers mobile-first savings accounts and unsecured loans.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>What stands out most about Marcus is that, where Goldman Sachs is best known for servicing high net worth individuals, Marcus targets the opposite demographic.&nbsp;<br><br>Marcus\u2019 main draw is low fees on loans and the fact that you can get industry-leading savings interest on balances as small as $1 \u2014 features that would attract low to middle-income earners.&nbsp;<br><br>Unlike Finn, whose offering was so similar to Chase\u2019s own that it ended up confusing customers, Marcus has been a resounding success for Goldman Sachs. In the fourth quarter of 2018, it racked up <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/goldmans-marcus-reaches-35-billion-deposits-2019-1?r=US&amp;IR=T\">$35 billion in deposits<\/a>. Even more impressive, the UK accounted for $7 billion of those deposits. This means that barely 8 months after launching in the UK, it had already surpassed established challengers like Atom Bank.&nbsp;<br><br>This success seems to have whetted Goldman Sachs\u2019 appetite for retail banking, eventually leading it to collaborate on developing the Apple Card. This only serves to show how off-shooting new brands can help the incumbent banks to branch out in unexpected business lines which would have otherwise not been possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Atom Bank<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Atom Bank specializes in mobile-first mortgages, business loans, and savings accounts. Unlike Marcus, which is owned by Goldman Sachs, Atom Bank isn\u2019t a traditional bank\u2019s offshoot. It is backed by Spanish banking giant BBVA, which has invested \u00a3130.4 million (about $168 million) and has a 39% ownership stake. <br><br>Atom Bank differentiates itself in three ways. Firstly, there\u2019s the speed. You can open a savings account in under 10 minutes. Secondly, it has low fees and low-interest rates on loans. Thirdly, the mortgage process is fully transparent. Customers have access to independent mortgage advice. And they can track the status of their application in the app, and get real-time updates. <br><br>By contrast, getting an update on your mortgage application from a traditional bank usually involves ringing them up and spending several minutes on hold.<br><br>As part of its wider strategy, BBVA has also invested in Holvi, a Finnish startup that offers a business account and features such as book-keeping, invoicing, and expense management.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The case for launching standalone brands<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As these examples show, banks have woken up to the need to change, building initiatives aimed at challenging the challengers. But why create a new brand that, ultimately, will also compete for market share instead of changing their own systems from within? There are three chief reasons for banks to do this: legacy, experimentation, and survival. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Problem With Legacy<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Where challenger banks have started from scratch, banks have decades of legacy to contend with. The largest banks have hundreds of offices and thousands of employees spread across the world, meaning it\u2019s simply not possible for them to be as agile and adaptable as fintechs. <br><br>At the same time, banks\u2019 core business relies on old systems that might not easily integrate with innovative features. And ditching these systems isn\u2019t always easy or straightforward. <br><br>Research from Temenos found that, for 32% of banks, legacy is the biggest obstacle to adopting new technology.  In this context, spinning off affords banks the best of both worlds. <br><br>On the one hand, they can leverage their data, reputation, and client-base to give the new project a head start. On the other, they can start fresh, without the technological challenges legacy creates. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>It\u2019s easier to experiment<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Separate brands afford banks the luxury of experimenting in a self-contained environment, without having to worry about legacy issues. Once the kinks have been ironed out, it\u2019s easier to make wider changes across the whole organization. <br><br>HSBC has done this with its Connected Money app. The bank has argued that they\u2019re not a tech company, nor do they want to be one. Rather, HSBC UK\u2019s Head of Digital Raman Bhatia explains: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cThe goal was to explore how open API technology could help customers in new ways by connecting their different financial products and service providers in one place\u201d <\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>With that goal achieved, it was time to start implementing their learnings into the bank\u2019s core infrastructure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Quest For Survival<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gartner.com\/en\/newsroom\/press-releases\/2018-10-29-gartner-says-digitalization-will-make-most-heritage-financial-firms-irrelevant-by-2030\">Gartner<\/a> reckons that by 2030, up to 80% of traditional financial services firms will struggle to stay relevant, because of digitalization. Instead of trying to be something they aren\u2019t, banks are reacting to this by choosing \u201cself-disrupt.\u201d<br><br>Their new mobile-first initiatives might poach customers from their traditional business. But those customers will stay within the group instead of moving to other challengers.<br><br>NatWest\u2019s Head of Innovation Andy Ellis <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessleader.co.uk\/why-are-the-high-street-banks-self-disrupting\/72279\/\">reasons that<\/a>:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201c<em>You can have a passive, steady decline, or you can go bold. It requires the ability and attitude to listen to customers and evolve with them. And it requires that you hold your nerve, develop new capabilities and think in a different way.<\/em>\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Looking ahead: the future of digital banking<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Launching digital offshoots is becoming increasingly popular amongst traditional banks. <br><br>But will it be enough to help them thrive in the digital age? <br><br>Finn\u2019s failure suggests that it isn\u2019t. In order to succeed, banks have to understand what their customers want and deliver products that not only meet these expectations but deliver more value than their traditional offering.<br><br>Ultimately, the key to this may be collaboration with the very businesses they compete with \u2014 fintechs.  Traditional banks have data, powerful distribution networks, financial know-how, and established customer bases.

The idea of a traditional bank is long gone, and there are many opportunities to provide financial institutions for a specific market segment. In this next series, we will equip you with the right information to go from an idea to build.<br><br>The first article will highlight 6 providers from Europe and the US that are at the forefront of  \u201cone-stop shops\u201d vendors for quickly launching a bank or fintech.&nbsp;<br><br>The banking-as-a-service (BaaS) model gained momentum off a few years ago, shortly after the early wave of unbundlers of financial services such as Moven, Mint or Paypal. BaaS providers quickly became the backbone of many neo banks and fintechs that were looking to create customer-centric products and services. <br><br>Their main advantage was speed to market, and the ability to easily cater to changing digital customer expectations. Some of these providers even acquired a banking license to augment those providers who do not want to undergo the process of applying for a banking license.<br><br>We have segmented the providers we will look at based on what types of companies they are servicing. First, the providers who primarily serve fintechs. They are priced on the less expensive side of the spectrum and focus on an easy-setup. Second, we look at providers who work with bigger enterprises and large banks. They are quite standardized and tend to have their own banking license. They can support very large products and enterprises. We will also highlight a wild card player in the US. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Solutions for smaller banks and fintechs<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Sni\u0301mka-obrazovky-2019-11-02-o-11.33.40.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-994\"\/><figcaption>Treezor website<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned above, a handful of providers are focusing on the newer players, predominantly pure-play fintechs. One is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.treezor.com\">Treezor<\/a>, a pure-play banking as a service provider operating since 2015.<br><br>Treezor is an e-money institution with a payment services license accredited by the French Prudential Supervision and Resolution Authority. It is a principal member of the Mastercard network and part of the SEPA network. In addition to financial institutions, it also targets traders and collaborative platforms. It\u2019s banking focus specifically highlights credit institutions and neo-banks. <br><br>In a nutshell, Treezor can offer a range of services from online acquiring, a card program, payments, KYC and compliance. In addition, it offers a holistic digital banking solution which includes: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>IBAN allocated to each wallet<\/li><li>Multi-currency wallets&nbsp;<\/li><li>Parent\/child wallets&nbsp;<\/li><li>SCT, SDD Core, SDD, B2B<\/li><li>P2P and wallet transfers<\/li><li>Plastic prepaid or debit card, including virtual payment cards<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>From a technical perspective, Treezor is purpose-built for quick integration and set-up. It offers a flexible API (REST or SOAP), while encouraging the creation of a test account to test the Treezor API in a sandbox. <br><br>Treezor currently works with a handful of niche banks and fintechs including Lydia, a neo-mobile bank for French millennials, Qonto, a neobank in France (and soon Spain, Germany and Italy) for freelancers and SMEs and Compete CO2, a payment card program that fights against climate change with a \u201cclimate currency.\u201d Treezor is a great out of the box solution to get your neo banking up and running with a prepaid or debit card. <br><br>Another vendor is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bnkbl.com\/\">Bankable<\/a>, which offers white-label payment solutions such as e-wallets, remittance services, P2P money transfers and prepaid card programmes. Bankable was founded in 2010 and recently announced a strategic partnership with Visa, boosting the BaaS capabilities. <br><br>Bankable\u2019s Digital Banking product suite is set-up to allow anyone to launch a digital bank from scratch, including IBAN accounts, payment cards and access to Faster Payments, SEPA and SWIFT. Companies that are not regulated can use this platform from Bankable. <br><br>Similar to Treezor, Bankable offers a solution primarily for consumer-facing fintechs or niche banks looking to offer a single or multi-currency offering, payments and IBANs, but the firm also fits nicely in the corporate segment, offering smart corporate card management. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Solutions for existing banks and larger enterprises<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Exploring the BaaS space if you are an established bank or a larger enterprise looking to make a play in financial services <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fidor.com\/\">Fidor Solutions<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.solarisbank.com\/en\/\">SolarisBank<\/a> are two standout vendors both hailing from Germany.&nbsp;<br><br>Fidor Solutions is the first digital-only bank in Germany and now commercializes&nbsp;its tech stack to banks and startups, while SolarisBank positions itself as a tech company with a full banking license. It allows companies to passport into Europe via its banking license and also offers a banking platform with highly advanced APIs. <br><br>Both providers can offer a comprehensive service including core components such as:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Bank license<\/li><li>Full onboarding, including real-time opening of accounts via video identification<\/li><li>Core banking services including IBANS, SEPA payments and multi-currency conversion<\/li><li>Cryptocurrency banking services (Fidor works with Kraken, while Solaris with Bison)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few differences between the two companies, largely dictated by the origination of each. For example, Fidor offers a Community Platform and also a white-label ready and responsive web and native app. On the other hand, Solaris appears to have the edge of working with more non-traditional financial companies, which makes sense given the fact it began purely as a B2B2C company. <br><br>A few considerations should be taken to understand which may be right for you. If you are a large enterprise, Fidor has worked previously with O2, launching the O2 bank in Germany. For crypto companies, Fidor has the edge having played in this space longer than Solaris. Furthermore, Fidor is able to provide a white label front end, while Solaris provides only bank-end solutions. <br><br>Solaris, however, has a more established record with early-stage fintechs such as Penta, Tomorrow and Kontist, and offers more of a pick and mix, modular solution available through their state-of-the-art APIs. Furthermore, it appears that the Solaris Banking License is more readily available for new entrants than Fidor. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Sni\u0301mka-obrazovky-2019-11-02-o-11.43.53.png\" alt=\"Solaris Bank\" class=\"wp-image-1003\"\/><figcaption>Solaris Bank website<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While Fidor and SolarisBank primarily cater to European companies, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.q2ebanking.com\/\">Q2ebanking<\/a> in the US has established itself as a leading BaaS vendor specializing in both technology and design. It offers an API-based solution for full accounts and debit card origination and payment processing and recently acquired Cloud Lending, offering fully digital lending capabilities. Besides the APIs, Q2 also offers a full-fledged digital banking platform that covers everything from the front-end user experience all the way to security and compliance backbone. Q2ebanking primarily works with credit unions, so while it may not be able to cater to large enterprises or banks, it appears to fill the gap in the middle of the road between fintechs and banks. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Wildcard<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It wouldn\u2019t be an article on innovative players if we didn\u2019t highlight one coming out of Silicon Valley. <a href=\"https:\/\/synapsefi.com\/\">Synapse<\/a> offers payment, deposit, lending and investment products as APIs to Fintech companies with a focus on the US. Amongst card issuance (both virtual and physical) for individual and business accounts, it also offers Savings Accounts, One-time loans, ACH Payments and Wire Payments via developer-friendly APIs. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"746\" height=\"482\" src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Sni\u0301mka-obrazovky-2019-11-02-o-11.42.51.png\" alt=\"Getting Technical: Synapse API for Card Processing\" class=\"wp-image-1004\" srcset=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Sni\u0301mka-obrazovky-2019-11-02-o-11.42.51.png 746w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Sni\u0301mka-obrazovky-2019-11-02-o-11.42.51-300x194.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 746px) 100vw, 746px\" \/><figcaption>Getting Technical: Synapse API for Card Processing<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This last part, developer-friendly APIs, is one of the reasons Synapse stands out. Their ethos is all about making it easier for companies to connect with banks, and in turn, for banks to automate and extend their back-end operations. Their play is focused on internet companies offering financial services, and with a Q4 2019 plan to launch in Europe and Canada, they could be an interesting option for those tech-focused companies looking to play in the banking space. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Now what?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This article highlighted a handful of providers that can offer you the most support in building your niche bank or fintech startup. While all providers offer the basics of cards, payments and issuing, each also has additional areas of expertise that can support various parts of a niche bank offering.&nbsp; <br><br>From a technical perspective, all providers provide innovative APIs and are purpose-built for smooth integrations. However, before progressing with selecting a BaaS provider, there are a handful of topics for consideration to ensure you select the right partner and start off on the right foot when building your niche bank:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>To what extent is your organization already experienced in financial services? Do you offer any tangential financial services at the moment? If not, do you plan to apply for your own banking or e-money license or not?<\/li><li>Do you have somebody in your team with deep financial services knowledge? It is valuable to have somebody to serve as a liaise between your team and these vendors. That applies for both the negotiation and deal set-up phase to ensure you do not come out shorthanded, as well as the deployment phase, where previous experience is invaluable to deliver on-time and smoothly.<\/li><li>What is your goal for launching the financial service? Which product or products will resonate most closely with your target customer segment? Some of these providers excel in certain product sets, while the fee structure for each will also vary. A strong understanding of the proposition is vital for selecting a provider to build your niche bank. <\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>While these providers above are great for a one-stop-shop, many niche banks have decided to take a pick and mix approach, taking some aspects of building a bank in house while outsourcing other components. In the upcoming articles, we will explore vendors for core parts of building a bank.<br><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>An overview of vendors offering one-stop shops to build a bank.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":8,"featured_media":4085,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":""},"categories":[13],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v16.4 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>One Provider To Build It All - Vacuumlabs<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"We have created an overview of providers offering one-stop shops to build a bank.

Similarly to commercial banks, credit unions provide an array of financial products such as loans, savings accounts or checking accounts to their end customers.<br><br>However, the credit union is collectively owned by all of its customers known as \u2018members\u2019. By consuming a service provided by a credit union, you automatically become its co-owner. This is not as simple as it sounds though \u2013 the membership is restricted and one needs to qualify to become a member.<br><br>What are the typical qualifying criteria? This depends on the specific profile of a credit union in question, but typically this would be an affiliation with any of the following (also known as \u2018field of membership\u2019 in credit union lingo):<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Employer<\/li><li>Family Ties<\/li><li>Geographical Location<\/li><li>Group Memberships<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The unique ownership structure has significant implications on how these organizations conduct their business. Not being driven primarily by profit generation, credit unions can employ resources towards improving the financial well being of their members by way of reducing service fees or offering competitive rates on loans or savings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A Niche Market?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Commercial retail banks are seen as market makers with significant economic power. This might be very well true, but credit unions play a significant part in financial markets and enabling financial inclusion worldwide. According to the World Council of Credit Unions report, there are more than 89 thousand active unions in 117 countries worldwide; encompassing more than 260 million members. In total, these unions manage more than $2.1 trillion of underlying assets.<br><br>Interestingly, geographical proliferation does not follow any apparent pattern. The biggest markets in terms of union members are the United States (100 million), India (20 million), Canada (10 million), Philippines (9.9 million), Brazil (9.6 million), Mexico (8.6 million.) or Kenya (6.8 million)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/atmFS.jpg\" alt=\"Credit Union\" class=\"wp-image-844\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s look at the United States &#8211; by far the largest credit union market &#8211; a bit more closely. As of 2019, there are more than approximately 5300 credit unions active in the US. They serve more than 43% of the economically active population in the country; while managing more than $1 trillion in assets under management.<br><br>Perhaps due to the lingering negative sentiment from the financial crisis of 2008 towards traditional retail <a href=\"https:\/\/inside.vacuumlabs.com\/fintech\/theres-a-bank-for-that\">banks<\/a>, credit unions seem to be faring well in the Americal marketplace. For example, credit union\u2019s share of credit card originations (typically a domain for traditional banks) has increased by 18% between 2015 and 2017; while market share on mortgage underwriting has increased by 7%.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Keeping Up With The Technology<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>\u201cEveryone is coming for credit union members. Everyone. Big banks, little banks, fintechs, venture capitalists, retailers, not to mention digital marketplaces like Amazon and Zillow, all see credit union members as a smooth pathway to market penetration.\u201d<\/em> <\/p><cite>Ben Rempe, COO of LenderClose<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to remember that despite their proliferation, on a \u2018unit basis\u2019, these are relatively small enterprises &#8211; the average credit union in the United States holds an average $286 million in assets. (this compared to $3.5 billion for the average US bank). The median assets under management are significantly smaller &#8211; just $35 million versus $230 million for the median bank.<br><br>This absence of economies of scale translates into technical debt. Banks invest billions of dollars into digital transformation projects, while fintech startups are pushing hard at leveraging new technology to deliver brand new customer experiences through digital channels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why Do We Believe Credit Unions Are Extremely Interesting?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The answer rests with customers. Credit unions have a specific customer &#8211; it has been proven that consumers with credit unions have better risk scores, higher credit card balances and credit card utilization, higher total debt while maintaining lower delinquency levels.<br><br>Most importantly, we see credit unions as \u2018trust centers\u2019 for various customer <a href=\"https:\/\/inside.vacuumlabs.com\/fintech\/the-business-of-the-niche-bank\">niches<\/a>. Given their unique business model and specialization on very specific customers segments, credit unions are extremely well-positioned to serve these customers in more authentic ways than the agnostic banks &#8211; that is, if they can figure out what financial and even non-financial products they can create and deliver in a meaningful digital experience to their members.<br><br>Consider the breadth and \u2018depth of focus\u2019 of some of the largest credit unions in the US. For example, Navy Federal, the largest US-based credit union with more than $100 billion in assets under management serves members in all branches of the armed forces, the Department of Defense, veterans and their families.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/moneyFS.jpg\" alt=\"Credit money\" class=\"wp-image-845\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Alliant Credit Union, formerly United Airlines Employees&#8217; Credit Union now offers membership to over 150 organizations and continues to offer services to communities around O&#8217;Hare International Airport in Chicago.<br><br>In another example, Suncoast Credit Union, with $9.3 billion in assets and more than 810,000 members; is headquartered in Florida and is open for business for people who live, work or attend school in the 17 counties which the credit union serves.<br><br>The Jackpot Question &#8211; what if these organizations with their niche focus, community-benefiting business model and broad customer bases are empowered with technology on par with the fintech challengers? This could be a significant value enabler &#8211; not just for the unions or community banks but more importantly for the communities or customer tribes (from teachers to military veterans to local communities) across the US and worldwide.<br><br>We believe financial services of the future will be ever-more personal, community and affiliation-based rather than based on a one-fit-all model. We are hard at work on making this vision a reality and we see credit unions as one of the key ecosystem stakeholders of the future.<br><br><em>Vacuumlabs is a centre of excellence in digital design and engineering with offices around the globe and strong focus on financial services. Through TribeFS, we are exploring the power of financial services which could be bundled together to serve the specific needs of customer tribes.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u201cUnfortunately, credit unions are typically not known for keeping up with bleeding-edge technology and advanced marketing tools

The term that we link with business suits and line graphs. What would you do if you could earn them on top of your salary and partially become a company owner? Earning equity shares has a lot of interesting benefits and these are the best three that we picked:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>You grow with the company<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Capital growth is one of the key benefits of owning company shares. This is especially true when you are part of the company. As the company grows in value, your shares are proportionally increasing in value too. Working at Vacuumlabs, you are directly contributing to the growth of the whole <strong>Vacuumlabs Group <\/strong>&#8211; that means you help other departments, Vacuumlabs\u2019 products (<a href=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/project\/adalite\">AdaLite<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/tribalbanking.com\">Tribal<\/a>) and spin-offs (<a href=\"https:\/\/inside.vacuumlabs.com\/technology\/reduced-redux-juraj-machacs-reactiveconf-talk\">ReactiveConf<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/sparring.io\">Sparring<\/a>) to succeed and thus benefit from their activities. At the same time, you are growing your own shares.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/agenda-analysis-business-plan-990818-1-1296x789.jpg\" alt=\"equity shares\" class=\"wp-image-805\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>You get dividends&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Every shareholder receives a <strong>dividend<\/strong> at the end of the financial year. The size of the financial reward depends on the proportion of shares you own and the scale of profit the company has made over the past year. Taking into account the rapid growth of Vacuumlabs, the value of your equity shares can rise sharply over a timeline of a few years. However, the size of the dividend is not fixed and in the case of company loss, you may not receive any return at all.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>You own the company<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Not all benefits are of a financial nature. Earning equity shares also makes you one of the <strong>company<\/strong> <strong>owners<\/strong>. It may not be a huge proportion, but to some extent, you are legally one of the many company owners. By acquiring company shares on top of your salary, you are not just receiving money. You are owning a piece of the pie that you help to build. Also, shareholders get company insights and can attend regular meetings where they can take part in decision-making processes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Join us<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Participating in the equity scheme certainly has a lot of benefits.

Their goal is to increase the number of women in the field through organising events, raising awareness about working in the IT field. In addition, they are writing blogs from women\u2019s perspective and introducing successful female programmers. Two of our colleagues, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ajtyvit.sk\/zeny-v-it\/olivia-kunertova\/\">Olivia<\/a> and <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ajtyvit.sk\/zeny-v-it\/klara-fickova\/\">Klara<\/a> shared their thoughts on the topic with Aj Ty v IT on International Girls in Information and Communication Technologies Day. You can support them on their <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ajtyvit.sk\/\">website<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>\u201cWe would certainly like to eliminate prejudices against women in the IT sector in terms of diversity and equality. For instance, young women might be discriminated for the high potential of having children in the upcoming years. Another example can be that women are thought to be worse programmers than men. However, most of the IT companies that I know are modern and their company culture is very mature. It\u2019s a pleasure to work there. At Aj Ty v It, we also try to share the word outside the field to inspire women to work in the IT. There are numerous ways that companies can use to increase equality in the IT sector. For example, they can organise workshops; implement flexible working hours; forbid sexual harassment and make strategic decisions somewhere else than in the bar or at sports events. They can also support women to create Lean In circles. \u201c<\/em><\/p><cite><strong>MARIA VIRCIKOVA, A CONSULTANT AT AJ TY V IT<\/strong><\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/IMG-1286-633x791.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-664\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Slovensko.digital<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Named similarly as the first project in this list, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/slovensko.digital\/\">slovensko.digital<\/a> also follows a similar goal.

This happens, either when you don\u2019t have a strict regimen at home or when you travel long distances.<br><br>Typically, your internal clock adjusts by one-hour every day. Thus, let\u2019s say a 7 hour time difference takes 7 days to get acclimated. However, this can be hacked by food and mental exercises.<br><br>Matej\u2019s special jetlag combating plan: Before you fly, change the time on your watch to match the one in your final destination. If for example, you have a 3 pm flight from Vienna to Hong Kong, you should already set your clock to 10 pm on your watch. Think of it, \u201cAaah, it\u2019s already 10 pm, let me have one beer and dinner, and I will just sleep on the plane\u201d.<br><br>In-plane, do not drink alcohol. That messes with you. Optimally, do not eat at all. A little bit of starvation never killed anybody. If you do this, you\u2019ll be a ninja in combating the jetlag. And then, you\u2019ll thank me a lot. Once you land, eat the next meal in the local timezone for the rest of the day (if its time for breakfast, have breakfast).<br><br>Never, I repeat, never take a nap after you land at the destination. Only go to bed after sunset and optimally after 9 or 10 pm. Sometimes its a struggle, but it\u2019s well worth it. When it\u2019s time to go to sleep, go to sleep, do not say it\u2019s too early or that you\u2019re not tired. Just go to bed at 10 pm. <br><br>Optimally every day you\u2019re at the destination. When doing long-distance, buy in advance melatonin pills (available prescription-free in some countries like Slovakia). Have one 60 minutes before you go to bed (at 9 pm). <br><br>I also use one on my long leg of the journey (if it\u2019s longer than 7 hours). Works like a charm. Exercise every day. Try to do at least 30\u200a\u2014\u200a45 minutes or exercise when in the destination. Helps you to wake up and not feel tired.<br><br>If you stick to this plan, you will have no jetlag in 2 days. With the food hack and fasting on the plane, you can accelerate the internal clock much faster.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/content_1-4-1294x791.jpg\" alt=\"traveling plan\" class=\"wp-image-634\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tip #2: Selecting the least agonising flight<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s not easy to choose the right flight for yourself. It\u2019s always good to spend time on sites like google flights (much recommended) or hipmunk (also awesome), to search for flights according to these rules:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Departure time doesn\u2019t play a role in my long-haul flight selection. Anything goes. The rest is so much more important.<\/li><li>Layover should not be shorter than 1:30hours and not longer than 4hours. Try to avoid more than one layover.<\/li><li>If there isn\u2019t a direct flight, choose a long flight and a short one. Always do the short leg first if possible. Do not sleep on the short leg, only sleep on the long leg.<\/li><li>Arrival time should be sometime in the afternoon but not too late. This way you have enough time to find your hotel, check-in, unpack, walk around the city and enjoy a nice dinner before taking a good night sleep (see Tip #1).<\/li><li>Always try avoiding working the same day you arrive. Use it to recover and get accustomed to the city, its smell, its vibe.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tip #3: Actually enjoying the airport<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Learning the inner works of your base airport and the specifics of your frequent routes can actually save you a lot of nerves and stress.<br><br>My home base in the Viennese airport and by learning the shorter routes and the emptier security lanes and the more obscure spots there, I\u2019m able to get from the car to the lounge in under 5 minutes. And then from the lounge to the plane under 5 minutes too.<br><br>Lounges are totally worth it if you travel often. People think it\u2019s hard to get into them, or that you can only get in if you have a business class ticket. That\u2019s just not true. Get a good debit\/credit card (like a MasterCard Gold) or buy PriorityPass (some banks give it for free to their premium clients, but I\u2019ve just bought mine) or get a one-time entry pass to your selected lounge (typically between 15\u201330 Eur).<br><br>Hence, in your starting location go to a lounge directly after security. Chill there, have a snack (according to the jetlag battling rules above), charge your computer and chill before your flight. I usually come 2 hours before the flight, so I don\u2019t stress with anything.<br><br>In your layover destination, also get into a lounge. If you\u2019re often travelling, get a PriorityPass card, if you don\u2019t travel very often, just pay the entry fee. In the lounge, you can sometimes shower, get a snack, lay down, get a massage or just relax. No need to sit on the uncomfortable seats in the airport.<br><br>Be sure to fill in your immigration documents correctly. You don\u2019t want to stress out just because you have forgotten to fill out something. Do this while on the plane. If you\u2019ll often fly to the destination, it\u2019s worth looking into EasyEntry ways for foreigners. For a fee, you\u2019ll be able to skip the lines at immigration. At Gatwick, it\u2019s only 5 pounds and totally worth it (on some days it saves over 30\u201340 minutes of waiting time).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/content_2-6-1294x791.jpg\" alt=\"travelling window seat on plane\" class=\"wp-image-635\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tip #4: Selecting the perfect seat<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting a good seat can mean the difference between a relaxed flight and a slow agonising nightmare. Some things you can influence, some of just pure luck. But you can help your luck, with some smart preparations. Here are my tips for perfect seats: It\u2019s worth paying extra for a good seat. Don\u2019t leave seat allocation to a computer. You\u2019ll regret it during the whole flight if you do that.<br><br>Get a window seat, it\u2019s perfect for sleeping.<br><br>Choose an exit row or a bulkhead seat (those after the split sections of bigger planes), has more space for legs. Choose them only if you\u2019re not overweight, as those seats tend to be more narrow and that can get very uncomfortable very quickly. If you get seats at the rear of the plane, there\u2019s less chance they will allocate the seat next to you to anybody. <br><br>Computes typically fill the flight from front rows to back. If you\u2019re flying with another companion, get the aisle and the window seat and leave the middle seat free. Unless it\u2019s a totally full flight, nobody will want to sit there, so you have a chance of a free seat next to you. Worst case scenario you switch with the person in the middle to be next to each other.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tip #5: Small things that make a lot of difference<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The rule here is to buy quality products that you can always reuse and that will be your trusty companions on the road for years to come. Buy a set of noise cancellation headphones. I recommend Bose QuietComfort 35 Mark II. You can thank me later.<br><br>Buy one of those pillows around your head that you can inflate. Makes a ton of difference.<br><br>Buy one of those eye masks and have it with you. Put it on if you want to sleep in the airplane (in accordance with the battling jetlag plan).<br><br>Always be hydrated on the flight. Buy a big bottle (0.5L) at the airport before you fly out. Drink it during flight. If you want to be eco, bring an empty bottle with you to the airport and fill it before the flight.<br><br>Get some sweet moisturising cream that you take with you. Hydrate your face regularly during the flight (it\u2019s not gay, it just feels really good).<br><br>Don\u2019t eat heavy foods, don\u2019t eat sweets, don\u2019t drink sweet drinks, optimally don\u2019t eat at all (in accordance with the battling jetlag plan).<br><br>Get a battery pack so that you can charge your many devices on the go.<br><br>Have some relaxing music (I recommend the app Calm) to listen in background for sleeping during travel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/content_3-1-1294x791.jpg\" alt=\"charging while travel\" class=\"wp-image-636\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n<p>[related_article]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tip #6: Operating normally in remote destinations<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The whole idea of travelling according to these tips is to give you maximum energy and focus levels for any hard work you\u2019re planning to do while far away from your home. Pack more rather than fewer things. Get a bigger suitcase, and don\u2019t stress about the efficiency of your packing. You\u2019re not competing for the most efficient packer, but for the least agony on the road. Plus, you\u2019ll have more space for souvenirs back home. Take immunity boosters to stay healthy in new environments. Namely, I use Immunoglukan, which boosts your immunity, thus even on long haul trips, you can stay healthy. It\u2019s s Slovak product and works wonders. Start with it one day before you fly and continue one or two days after you come back home.<br><br>Always have your passport and some cash in your pocket. (But have a copy of it digitally somewhere too). I carry around 200 USD dollars with me in the pocket for whatever reason. Also, I usually carry around 100 USD equivalent in the local currency, just if something needs to be paid cash. Otherwise, I always pay with a card.<br><br>Stash some of your credit cards, ID\u2019s and cash somewhere safe (like the hotel safe). You really don\u2019t want to be stuck in a foreign country with no cash, no cards and no ID if somebody robs you.<br><br>Stick to your daily regimen just as you would be at home. Or at least try to get as close to it as possible. And don\u2019t go too heavy on drinks or trying to see everything in the limited time you\u2019re there. Remember, reason #1 you\u2019re travelling is <a href=\"https:\/\/inside.vacuumlabs.com\/category\/business\">business<\/a>, so make sure your actions don\u2019t hinder your work performance. Thus don\u2019t skip meals, workout and go to sleep at a reasonable time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/content_4-1294x791.jpg\" alt=\"travel\" class=\"wp-image-638\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, travel can be a lot of fun, not a lot of pain and if executed properly, can be smooth sailing without destroying your energy levels.

This <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/reactiveconf.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">bold claim was made<\/a> by Cardano\u2019s co-founder, Charles Hoskinson, when discussing the launch of its Phase 2, dubbed Shelley. Shelley\u2019s launch will showcase Cardano\u2019s one-of-a-kind Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm, which Charles asserts will also result in <a href=\"https:\/\/inside.vacuumlabs.com\/crypto\/safety-over-everything-developing-cryptocurrency-wallet-in-js\">Cardano<\/a> having a throughput and transaction volume 30 times larger than Bitcoin.<br><br>Of course, such grandiose claims are nothing new to crypto, and Shelley has a lot of hype to live up to. Whether it can do so remains to be seen, but that\u2019s not the point of today\u2019s article. This article is about understanding Shelley and Cardano\u2019s PoS algorithm, so you will be able to make a more informed decision on whether you want to and how you can meaningfully participate in the Cardano ecosystem (and even make passive income in doing so).<br><br>Let\u2019s begin with a quick intro to Cardano.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cardano Condensed: A Brief Explainer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cardano\u2019s goal is to be a self-sustaining, scalable smart contracts platform\u2014essentially a superior version of Ethereum. Considering that both Ethereum and Cardano share the same co-founder, Charles Hoskinson, this isn\u2019t too surprising.<br><br>In that respect, Cardano is nothing new. But Cardano has taken an interesting route by ensuring its operating theories are as valid and rigorous as possible before even beginning to implement them. It does this by first <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cardano.org\/en\/academic-papers\/\" target=\"_blank\">publishing academic papers<\/a> related to said theories and putting them through a peer-review process (a first for crypto). One of the things that has gone through this process is its PoS protocol, the main subject of this article.<br><br>At present, Cardano is supported by three entities: IOHK (engineering and technology), Emurgo (business marketing), and the non-profit Cardano Foundation (education\/marketing). Collectively, they hold about 20% of the circulating supply of ADA, Cardano\u2019s native token.<br><br>Cardano officially completed its <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/cardanoroadmap.com\/en\/byron\/\" target=\"_blank\">first development phase<\/a>, Byron, in March 2019. It succeeded in building the project\u2019s foundation, launching ADA\u2019s wallets and getting it listed on over 30 exchanges\u2014where it holds a total market value of about US$1.2 billion as of September 2019 \u2014and fostering a strong and supportive community of enthusiasts and developers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/cardanoFS-1296x728.jpg\" alt=\"cardano and shelley\" class=\"wp-image-694\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Shelley: Transitioning from Federated Centralization to True Decentralization<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cardano emerged from the Byron era with IOHK, Emurgo, and the Cardano Foundation firmly in control of its entire ecosystem\u2014a model known as federated centralization. Obviously, this violates crypto\u2019s founding principle of decentralization, which is what its second phase\u2014Shelley\u2014intends to solve.<br><br>But to explain the mechanisms behind Shelley, we must first understand PoS consensus algorithms and some of their drawbacks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Proof of Stake 101: Understanding Consensus Mechanisms<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>All cryptocurrencies must answer a fundamental question\u2014without any central authority, how can participants in the network come to an agreement as to who owns what? The answer is a consensus algorithm, the mechanism used to reach an agreement on the final state of the blockchain.<br><br>The first and most famous solution and one that Bitcoin uses is Proof of Work (PoW). In this model, transactions are validated and added to the blockchain through mining, wherein miners race to solve a cryptographic puzzle. <br><br>For malicious actors to successfully attack a PoW crypto, they must be able to control at least 51% of its hash power (although even controlling smaller but significant percentages can still allow them to do damage)\u2014which will give them the ability to alter the blockchain to their benefit (for instance by <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/cardanoroadmap.com\/en\/byron\/\" target=\"_blank\">double spending<\/a>). <br><br>In large networks, such attacks would be prohibitively expensive\u2014for Bitcoin, a 51% attack would <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crypto51.app\/\" target=\"_blank\">cost approximately US$800k per hour<\/a>.<br><br>While large PoW networks are highly secure (smaller ones less so), the PoW model also has its drawbacks, primarily scalability and energy costs. It can take minutes to mine a single block, as in the case of Bitcoin, which limits its ability to scale. Further, it costs real energy to mine blocks, which raises credible environmental concerns.<br><br>Because of these drawbacks with PoW, cryptos such as Cardano opt for a PoS algorithm instead (even Ethereum is switching from PoW to PoS). In a PoS system, everyone who owns said crypto could \u2018stake\u2019 their share to potentially be selected to be the next block creator (and receive block rewards), with the probability of selection being proportional to their stake. <br><br>As there are no cryptographic puzzles to solve\u2014and thus no specialized hardware required\u2014practically anybody can participate in governance. The result: a far more scalable, democratized, and energy-efficient system.<br><br>However, PoS systems are not without their own problems. In the next section, we will discuss some of their challenges, and how Cardano\u2019s PoS algorithm\u2014which it calls Ouroboros\u2014plans to tackle them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/ouroborosFS-1187x791.jpg\" alt=\"ouroboros\" class=\"wp-image-695\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Challenge #1 of PoS Systems \u2013 Higher Attack Vulnerability<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The first challenge is obvious. To launch a 51% attack, all it takes is acquiring 51% of the supply. On an intuitive level, this is much easier to do than capturing most a network\u2019s hash power, as in PoW systems. However, similar to PoW systems, size provides security. At ADA\u2019s current market value, it would cost over US$600 million for such an attack\u2014there is simply not enough liquidity on the market to carry out such an attack, and that\u2019s without even accounting for the price increases that would result from large-scale buying.<br><br>It is important to keep in mind that all cryptos are vulnerable to 51% attacks, regardless of the consensus algorithm they use\u2014there is no such thing as a perfect consensus algorithm. Because of the very definition of consensus, a decentralized system must always presume that at least a slight majority of its participants are honest\u2014slight majority meaning miners\u2019 hash power in the case of PoW algorithms and stakeholders in the case of PoS algorithms.<br><br>This is the unavoidable tradeoff of a decentralized currency. As <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/news\/litecoins-charlie-lee-decentralized-crypto-must-be-susceptible-to-51-attacks\" target=\"_blank\">Charlie Lee, the founder of Litecoin put it<\/a>:<br><br>\u201cBy definition, a decentralized cryptocurrency must be susceptible to 51% attacks whether by hash rate, stake, and\/or other permissionlessly-acquirable resources. If a crypto can&#8217;t be 51% attacked, it is permissioned and centralized.\u201d<br><br><em>\u201cIf you can choose your meals according to your values, why wouldn\u2019t you be able to choose your banking according to your values?&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n<p>[related_article]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Challenge #2 of PoS Systems \u2013 Dynamic Availability<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Dynamic availability is the flip side to the democratized nature of PoS systems. Theoretically, all token holders can become stakeholders (node operators), and participate in the system\u2019s governance. But to do this, you would have to be online all the time\u2014an unrealistic expectation.<br><br>Cardano\u2019s developers understood that not all ADA holders will be interested in directly participating in its governance. At the same time, they would also like to share in the potential block rewards. Hence, Cardano\u2019s innovation is to give you the option of delegating your ADA holdings to a chosen stake pool.<br><br>Stake pools are simply groupings of ADA holdings where their leaders have the chance of being chosen as the next slot leader (with the probability of being chosen to be proportional to the size of the stake pool). <br><br>When you delegate your stake to a pool, you are giving up your right to participate in governance, but you can still share in the block rewards. Further, delegating your stake does not limit your ability to freely spend and trade ADA\u2014you can still use your ADA wallet as normal.<br><br>Stake pools also operate in a free market environment. While anyone can register to operate a stake pool, you can switch stake pools at any time, meaning stake pool operators must compete with each other. This incentivizes them to provide the highest possible uptime for their pools, which is beneficial for the Cardano ecosystem as a whole.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Challenge #3 of PoS Systems \u2013 Potential Formation of Destructive Oligopolies<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The third challenge is a microcosm of today\u2019s economy\u2014the rich getting richer. With governance being directly tied to the amount of tokens held, the lion\u2019s share of the block rewards will tend to go to the largest stakeholders. <br><br>Left unchecked, the eventual result might be an oligopoly. At worst, this makes it easier for oligarchs to collude and launch a 51% attack. At best, it leads to a more centralized ecosystem.<br><br>One part of Cardano\u2019s solution to this is to limit the maximum block rewards a single stake pool can receive. This diminishing returns mechanism will put a natural cap on stake pool sizes. However, this does not prevent a single party from creating multiple smaller pools\u2014destructive oligopolies could still emerge.<br><br>Hence, drawing on game theory as a prevention method, Cardano will increase the potential block rewards of stake pools where their leaders have pledged a portion of their own personal stake. Such stake pools would naturally attract higher amounts of delegated stakes from ADA holders and thus become the more dominant pools. <br><br>This means that to create many large stake pools, someone would have to post huge amounts of their personal stake to all these pools\u2014making it prohibitively expensive to form oligopolies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Delegated Stake Pools and Passive Income Opportunities<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many people are interested in Cardano but can\u2019t be bothered with the more technical side of things. To cater to those people, Cardano provides the opportunity for earning passive income through stake delegation. Once Shelley is launched, you will be able to delegate your stake and earn block rewards\u2014without even having to \u2018lock-up\u2019 your ADA.<br><br>And if you\u2019re worried that the process of delegating your stake will be overly complex\u2014don\u2019t be, it couldn\u2019t be more convenient. As long as you already have an ADA wallet, you will be able to easily delegate your funds in the said wallet to your chosen stake pool or pools. <br><br>Again, this won\u2019t affect your ability to spend your funds at all.

Before AdaLite, the only option was the official Daedalus heavy wallet. It\u2019s inconvenient to install because it requires to download and synchronise a copy of blockchain initially and during each startup. <br><br>In 2018, we at Vacuumlabs, as big fans and holders of Cardano cryptocurrency, have decided to help the Cardano ecosystem by developing a light, secure multi-platform wallet that users can access easily with a web-browser without the need to download anything. <br><br>Our inspiration for this project was a favourite Ethereum web-based wallet MyEtherWallet. We code-named the project CardanoLite but later renamed it to AdaLite to better reflect the currency for the wallet.<br><br>Early in the project, we encountered many difficulties arising from the fact that Cardano was still a young project and it missed more in-depth technical specification and documentation. To proceed with our project, we had to reverse engineer Daedalus.<br><br>Initially, we decided to provide 2 types of access to the wallet by seed phrase and encrypted .JSON. Both these accesses are insecure because they require the handling of sensitive data in an insecure way and are vulnerable to different types of potential attacks. They also require that the user trusts that AdaLite website won\u2019t steal their sensitive data. <br><br>Therefore, from the beginning, we developed the wallet keeping in mind that our product is complete and acceptable for users only once we provide the possibility of trustless secure access through a trusted hardware wallet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/content_1-3-1024x532.jpg\" alt=\"Adalite mockup\" class=\"wp-image-565\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"532\" src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/content_2-5-1024x532.jpg\" alt=\"Adalite mockup\" class=\"wp-image-566\" srcset=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/content_2-5-1024x532.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/content_2-5-300x156.jpg 300w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/content_2-5-768x399.jpg 768w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/content_2-5.jpg 1248w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>We are happy that we managed to achieve this and together with Trezor we provide the Cardano community with a new secure way to manage their ADA cryptocurrency. <br><br>This way, the user always stores their private key on the Trezor hardware wallet. It isn\u2019t necessary for the user to trust us when accessing their wallet through AdaLite website.<br><br>You can use the wallet on any browser and operating system without the need to download anything. It takes just a few seconds to generate new or access an existing wallet, and it is straightforward to use. We don\u2019t store any sensitive data about you, and your private key never leaves your computer, the signing of transactions completes in your browser (or, in case you are using Trezor, they complete it on their end). <br><br>On top of it, AdaLite works with smartphones so you can access your funds from anywhere anytime. As far as we know, we are the only mobile friendly wallet currently on the market.<br><br>AdaLite wallet currently has one limitation compared to Daedalus. It is limited to 10 pre-defined (sequentially derived) addresses per wallet. This implementation implies that wallets created on Daedalus client won\u2019t correctly work on AdaLite. <br><br>The reason is that after each transaction, Daedalus randomly derives new address, therefore when checking for wallet balance, Daedalus scans the whole blockchain for possible addresses that belong to given wallet\u2019s private key. Mimicking it would be complicated to do for multiple users on a server every time they try to access their wallet. <br><br>Therefore, we decided for this limitation as we believe most of the users are fine with a single address per wallet (and we provide them with 9 extra, should they need more). Imported Daedalus wallets do work, but will most likely show 0 balance (as we aren\u2019t monitoring the randomly generated addresses), unless you are keeping your funds on the first address that was generated by Daedalus that is identical with first AdaLite address. It is worth to note that AdaLite wallets are fully compatible and you can import them to Daedalus.<br><br>We don\u2019t want to stop with just Trezor integration. We have some bold plans. We want to integrate with Nano Ledger once it supports Cardano. We plan to maintain compatibility and interoperability with all future official Cardano releases. This way we can guarantee a possibility to fall back to the official wallet for any reason. We also want to support interaction with smart contracts once released and provide an interface for staking delegation and much more. Right now, we are listening to the community and working to implement features deemed most useful.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>[related_article]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/mockup_ledger@2x-1296x791.jpg\" alt=\"Ledger Adalite Wallet\" class=\"wp-image-567\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Code for AdaLite wallet is publicly auditable and easy to review on GitHub.

Banking has typically been characterized by a few broad customer segments:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Individual (mass, affluent, high net worth)<\/li><li>SME<\/li><li>Corporate<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, let\u2019s think about the disruption in financial services. It has historically tended to start with the consumer segment, and then permeate upstream into the SME and Corporate spaces.<br><br>The nature of segmentation and manner in which digital disruption occurs makes the SME and Corporate segments ready for disruption from niche banks. Furthermore, potential new entrants in this space are at an advantage as they can look to what success and failures of niche bank disruptors in the individual space.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Current state of play<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The current wave of niche SME neo-banks is largely focused on the type of business, rather than the industry in which the business operates. For example, Kontist and Coconut are two examples of niche banks catering to the solopreneur and freelance segment respectively. This has created a nice starting point for the next wave of disruptors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/kontist@2x.jpg\" alt=\"niche banks mockup\" class=\"wp-image-550\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Corporate space, however, is yet to experience a holistic neo-bank revolution. Instead, we are seeing a range of fintechs and vendors that are supporting the various players of the Corporate banking value chain (e.g. Kantox) for the leading global banks and also high levels of cross-bank collaboration (e.g. R3), specifically in the blockchain space.<br><br>We see two primary ways in which niche banks can evolve and compete in the SME and Corporate segments. Within the SME space, new niche banks can focus on incorporating value-added services in addition to core banking products based on the sector in which the business operates. <br><br>Moving up to the Corporate segment, we envisage something more disruptive. Will large corporates start partnering with banking-as-a-service (BaaS) and other tech-first companies at an ever-greater pace to create financial products and services to achieve greater customer lifetime value?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Barbershop, Blockchain and Bakery: The secret sauce to the SME niche bank<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What <a href=\"https:\/\/getcoconut.com\/\">Coconut<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/getpenta.com\/\">Penta<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/kontist.com\/\">Kontist<\/a> (amongst others) have done for the respective customer segments has really set the ball rolling for innovations within the SME world. Creating bank accounts that are tailored to how the business operates, rather than solely based on turnover, has certainly saved many hours for business hours in their respective markets.<br><br>We see the next wave of offerings in the SME space going one step further, and catering to specific industries. We are beginning to see such offerings &#8211; Squire and its play into the Barber Shop space serves here as a great case in point.<br><br>Squire is a Y-combinator backed business management platform for barbershops, operating in 28 cities in the US and processing more than $100 million in transactions since 2016. It positions itself as an all-in-one platform to power barbershop operations, offering:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A CRM system<\/li><li>Marketing platform<\/li><li>Payroll management<\/li><li>E-commerce<\/li><li>Appointment scheduling<\/li><li>POS solutions<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Squire is not a bank, nor does it offer any core banking products and or services besides the POS capability. However, Squire could easily partner with an existing bank or utilize a BaaS provider with a license to begin offering business current accounts or specialize in lending for barbershops looking to expand their operations. Alternatively, a new bank looking to carve out a niche in the personal grooming space could easily partner with Squire to complement its core banking services with non-core banking services to truly be the one-stop-shop for barbershop owners.<br><br>While Squire is targeting industries with physical operations, there is one sector in the tech space that has received quite a bit of attention in terms of niche offerings from banks. We are beginning to see the development of niche banks also in the cryptocurrency and blockchain industries largely from established tech-first banks. Solaris Bank and Fidor Bank, two BaaS providers, have created specialized services for businesses in the blockchain and cryptocurrency spaces aimed at businesses on the medium to the larger end of the business spectrum.<br><br>The Solaris Blockchain Factory offers a Pooling Account Solution, that tackles the issues cryptocurrency exchanges or marketplaces are faced when it comes to custodial, AML and fiat to crypto on and off-ramping. Fidor Bank offers it\u2019s Crypto As a Service, offering a specific solution for those companies looking to ICO in addition to Exchange Accounts. One to watch is Founders Bank Project, an early stage Malta-based startup that is looking to set up a corporate challenger bank for companies in the blockchain, crypto and tech industries.<br><br>The barbershop, cryptocurrency and blockchain industries are a handful of industries in which niche banks can successfully operate. The secret sauce here is to integrate non-core banking products and services into a holistic platform to truly be part of the end to end customer lifestyle while localizing on a particular market or region.<br><br>For example, Germany is ranked the 5th largest bakery market in the world and is the largest in the European Union (EU). A niche bank can take a look at this segment and create a bank based on the core financial needs of bakeries (of course segmenting between small, medium and large) and incorporating non-core banking services such as specific inventory tools, digital tools and platforms for banking courses, loyalty and so on.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>[related_article]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/coconut-1296x594.jpg\" alt=\"niche bank\" class=\"wp-image-640\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Large Corporates: The next neo-banks?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So far we have discussed the potential for our traditional view of a bank to become a niche bank. However, as we travel further up the business spectrum to the larger corporates, we see greater scope for businesses to offer financial services themselves. Bringing financial services in-house can be achieved via strategic partnerships.<br><br>Perhaps one of the most known examples is the partnership between Uber and GoBank in the US. The Uber Checking account by GoBank provides tailored services to Uber drivers, such as 2x cash back at gas stations and auto-care companies. For example, drivers can receive a 3% Cash Back at Exxonmobil and a 15% discount on select services at Jiffy Lube, an auto-care company. The bank account is promoted to drivers when they sign up to become an Uber driver. Another feature specific to Uber drivers is the ability to \u201ccash-out\u201d up to 5 times per day for free.<br><br>Aside from the Uber Checking account, there is a huge potential for Uber to offer financial products and services to its lesser-known segments. For example, Uber for Business has created a suite of products revolving around its business customer needs. It offers:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Employee travel management solutions<\/li><li>Easy integrations for travel expenses<\/li><li>Courtesy rides as a way to increase loyalty<\/li><li>Shuttle programs for events<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Uber is in a prime position to partner with a bank or offers its own services to provide a one-stop-shop for travel management and banking. We wouldn\u2019t expect Uber to become the primary bank for its business and corporate customers, but it could create a unique unbundled offering in corporate expense, payment reconciliation and even corporate card space.<br><br>Large corporates in the luxury goods sector could also take financial services in house, specifically as a means for increasing customer loyalty. This could coincide with the rise of metal-like cards we are seeing in the consumer space. Consumers loyal to the likes of Louis Vuitton, Bentley, or W-Hotels could see cards, perks or perhaps investment products that play to their brand loyalty and desire for exclusivity. <br><br>Imagine a gold plated credit card offered by Louis Vuitton for customers spending a certain amount per year, or exclusive investment opportunities into mobility initiatives for Bentley car owners. These plays are becoming increasingly easy with the rise of BaaS providers and fintechs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/hero-15.jpg\" alt=\"niche banks\" class=\"wp-image-553\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Endless opportunities<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The SME and Corporate segments are ripe for the emergence of niche banks, with the groundwork being laid by the first wave of neo-banks such as Kontist or Coconut and strategic banking partnerships by a few large tech companies.<br><br>As we discussed in the previous articles, we expect to see individuals begin selecting banking and financial products that are truly tailored to their needs, beliefs or culture.

Up until around 2012, banks appeared to be immune from such disruption. However, around 2012 the rise of the neo-banks and unbundlers began.<br><br>There are countless drivers behind the rise of the neo-banks, but two important factors have propelled the rise. First, the opening up of the market for new entrants and further innovation by regulators. <br>In the UK, perhaps the epicentre of neo-banks and disruption, this was accelerated by the country\u2019s forward-thinking regulators and countless Sandbox initiatives. <br><br>Second, the overarching one size fits all model of banking products. Customer segmentation was largely based on wealth (e.g. mass Market vs private vs. high net worth) or in the case of businesses, a simplistic classification by their turnover.<br><br>The first wave of the neo-banks was characterized by the Simples\u2019 and Movens\u2019 of the world, which aimed to differentiate from traditional banks in two ways. <br><br>First, a banking experience entirely and exclusively on mobile, and second by offering next-generation personal finance management (PFM) aimed at the masses, based on \u2018safe to spend\u2019 analysis and enhanced categorisation.<br><br>The next wave of neo-banks saw the launch, and subsequent catapult to Unicorn status, of <a href=\"https:\/\/n26.com\/en-eu\">N26<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.revolut.com\/en-NL\">Revolut<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/monzo.com\/\">Monzo<\/a>. These banks continued with the mobile-first and great PFM approach as their predecessors, but also focused on external partnerships, marketplaces, beautiful design and most importantly, a low-cost option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/paybyphonefs-1187x791-1-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4128\" srcset=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/paybyphonefs-1187x791-1-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/paybyphonefs-1187x791-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/paybyphonefs-1187x791-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/paybyphonefs-1187x791-1.jpg 1187w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>The new neo-bank<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What does the neo-banking (or niche banks) scene of today look like? There is one key difference in how the new banks of 2018 and 2019 differ from their predecessors, and that is their focus on a specific customer segment with unique needs. Today, \u201cmobile or digitally savvy\u201d customers just aren\u2019t a true specific segment.<br><br>The neo-banks of today, or niche banks, are continuing to build upon what Monzo, N26 and Revolut have achieved, but tailoring their entire product offering, design, and brand towards a particular segment. <br><br>This includes customer segments with particular beliefs, concerns, or ways in which they engage with technology. By going niche, a whole host of doors are unlocked in terms of offering truly contextualised, relevant and customer-friendly solutions.<br><br>Everyone reading this post is a bank customer, but how many of us feel that our bank is solving our unique pain points besides offering us the baseline financial products such as current account or a payment card?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What do the niche banks look like?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We will explore a few new niche banks, and demonstrate how they were created to cater to a particular niche. These banks cater to a very broad spectrum of customers and are fantastic examples of how their product vision resonates across every touchpoint of the customer experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>TMRW Bank<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s start with TMRW Bank, the digital-bank offered from UOB, designed for millennials in Thailand.<br><br>TMRW was built completely from scratch with the sole purpose of meeting the financial needs of ASEAN millennials. It is designed to cope with each distinct market and taps into the regional UOB Engagement Labs (unit set up by UOB bank to leverage behavioural insights to deepen customer engagement) in order to experiment and learn from potential customers. <br><br>The bank partnered with two fintech firms and learned from market leaders as well as millennial brands to explore the latest technological and behavioural insights to deepen customer engagement.<br><br>A handful of features are applicable to the millennial segment:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Millennials prefer simplicity and engaging user experience and therefore the app does not have a traditional app menu, instead, the bank will learn from each customer\u2019s usage to bring upfront functions and information that is personalised to their needs<\/li><li>Taking reference from popular messaging apps, TMRW is the first digital bank in the world to feature a call function within its digital chat service<\/li><li>Millennials respond better to prompts that are fun and do not make them feel guilty. TMRW has a distinctive gaming feature in its approach to money management, where customers build a virtual city that gets bigger as their savings increase. According to UOB, the game quickly became one of its customers\u2019 favourite features because it helped them meet their savings goal whilst being fun and engaging.<\/li><li>Other useful features built into TMRW include transaction insights and travel summaries of users spending<\/li><li>TMRW&#8217;s app eliminates the use of banking jargon for a simpler and more engaging experience, the result of ethnographic research on millennials conducted by UOB before it launched TMRW<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><br>TMRW is a fine example of engaging customers from the onset of the build and translating every feature, design component, and usability based on the results of those engagements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/tmrwBank-1024x538.png\" alt=\"niche banks mockups\" class=\"wp-image-479\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/insha-1024x538.png\" alt=\"insha\" class=\"wp-image-478\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Insha<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Insha is a digital bank offered by Bahrain\u2019s Albaraka Turk and powered by Solaris Bank. It was launched in Germany, with plans to extend into other parts of Europe. It is the second bank in Germany to manage the money of its customers according to the rules of Islamic Banking (there are 20 million Muslims in the EU and 4.7 million Muslims in Germany). Adherence to Islamic Banking principles is the key driver behind how this bank fulfils the needs and value of its target customer segment. Insha cleverly explains their relational with the following question:<br><br><em>\u201cIf you can choose your meals according to your values, why wouldn\u2019t you be able to choose your banking according to your values?&#8221;<\/em><br><br>What\u2019s applicable to customers who wish to bank according to Islamic banking principles?<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Interest-free banking principles<\/li><li>No investments in alcohol<\/li><li>Although the app is available in German, it caters to individuals whose mother tongue may not be Germany. For example, users can choose between German Turkish and English.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><br>In addition to a bank based on Islamic principles, it has a Mosque finder and Zakat Calculator (Zakat is a payment made annually under Islamic law on certain kinds of property and used for charitable and religious purposes). Furthermore, it includes all the nicely designed and convenient features one would expect from a mobile-first bank, and it truly adheres to the fact it\u2019s built based on values.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>[related_article]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tomorrow Bank<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Tomorrow is a German bank, again powered by Solaris. It is a mobile-first bank with an ethos of living and banking sustainability, backed by it\u2019s a sustainability promise. It utilises open discussions around how money can be part of the solution for a sustainable future.<br><br>Upon early customer testing, the team realised there was certainly a market for those looking for a bank that focuses on sustainability. Within the first 20 minutes of their first social media post, they had 150 applicants for testing.<br><br>What makes everything about Tomorrow sustainable?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Finances renewable energy, organic agriculture, and microcredit projects<\/li><li>Makes an active contribution to climate change when the credit card is used<\/li><li>Uses an Impact Board that shows customers exactly where their money is working. For example, they can see how many trees have been planted thanks to their purchases<\/li><li>Collates customer feedback and testing via the Tomorrow Forum, a 24\/7 exchange about what Tomorrow should look like technically, ethically and organisationally<\/li><li>They are currently working towards certification as B-Corp, a special designation for ethical businesses<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Tomorrow features and design meet a highly transparent and truly passionate bank about sustainability.

When customers registered, they could choose their \u201cunique\u201d colour pallet for their banking app and \u2018rename\u2019 the bank based on their name (for example, my bank would be \u201cThe Bank of Matej.\u201d). <br><br>Kudos for what they were trying to achieve but nothing about these features constitute a banking experience truly tailored to an individual.<br><br>Today, we are on that path toward establishing greater personalisation in financial services. While this may never get to the individual level, we are starting to see more solutions focusing on particular nuances of segments, or tailored to specific beliefs or requirements. <br><br>It goes above and beyond the most obvious way to personalise banking experience by implementing machine learning or AI capabilities. In our opinion, it\u2019s a fantastic way forward. <br><br>By deeply aligning their purpose, vision and brand around a particular niche, these banks can capitalise on actual jobs in their customers&#8217; daily lives, potentially catering to more touchpoints than traditional banks can who simply add some incremental technology to &#8216;personalize&#8217; their platforms.<br><br>With the rise of banking-as-a-service providers and vendors available to build a bank, there is an unlimited opportunity for going niche for startups and incumbent banks alike.

This happens from time to time. You can fix it just by disclosing the context to Helen and continue with the discussion. However, even then, she might not contribute that well since she was prepared for the meeting not knowing the brief.<br><br>If you fail to identify this problem, you might risk ending up repeating your opinions over and over, therefore, failing to create a productive discussion\u2014effectively wasting your time and energy.<br><br>Avoid misinterpretation. Prepare for the meeting and align on what\u2019s already set.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>[related_article]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Focus<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So, everybody is aligned and prepared for the meeting when suddenly a notification pops up. Your pickup count in Screen Time increases. Now, you&#8217;re drawn away from the discussion.<br><br>Sounds familiar? It does to me, at least. Apart from the smartphone issue, there are plenty of other causes that might prevent me from being focused. Does my colleague repeat himself? <br><br>My mind drifts away from a meeting room. Am I present in a debate I keep feeling I can\u2019t contribute to? There\u2019s definitely a better use of my time. Does someone have a negative attitude or exercise their ego? Sooner or later, I\u2019ll get affected by such behaviour as well.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you notice your partner has lost focus, remember it doesn\u2019t always have to be their fault. Ask yourself: Am I brief enough or do I keep rephrasing my stance over and over again? Is this still a discussion, or a monologue?<br><br>Consider leaving your phone in another room, or switching it to a flight mode during the meeting. <em>Be brief, don&#8217;t repeat yourself and remain engaged<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3. Humility<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you are aligned and determined to maintain focus, imagine this:<br><br>You came up with the flow for a hotel room booking app, a project you&#8217;re currently working on. So, you show it to your colleagues, but they aren&#8217;t nearly as excited as you thought they would be. They dismiss it quickly, and it weighs really hard on you. <br><br>Now, situations like this make us vulnerable, yes. You open yourself to present a creative work, which you consider bright, and you get turned down right away.<br><br>As in the two previous pillars, there are lessons for both sides: the one who presents the design and for those who review it. Both are the lessons of humility:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The one who presents the design should exercise their&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/the-year-of-the-looking-glass\/taking-feedback-impersonally-7c0f3a8199d9\">growth mindset<\/a>, take a critique impersonally and search for what they can learn.<\/li><li>The one who reviews the design should remember they are there to collaborate on improvement and the presenter has spent more time thinking about the solution than they did.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The lack of humility is a tricky thing. It can be easily identified on other people, yet super hard to spot on ourselves. Every one of us could benefit from being a bit more humble.<br><br>Humility fosters growth.<br><br>P.S.: While writing this article, I became an advocate of using the word discussion over feedback: discussion is, by definition, a two-way information exchange while feedback is, more or less, one-way response to a specific performance. If you are reading this, I challenge you: schedule a design discussion with your colleagues and pay attention to the conversation.<br><br>You\u2019ll see how easily you can spot the conversation flaws. <em>Let&#8217;s have a good design discussion.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There is a tool that designers often overlook\u2014feedback.

Before that, I had worked on some client projects where it didn\u2019t go well, the expectations of both sides were different, or when the design work was successful, the implementation part was not right.

How do you decide that a product is good enough to ship?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Usually, I like what I create. With UI kits it\u2019s more about designing the core visual language, and a couple of default elements, patterns and colour palette. The rest is about copying, reusing and adjusting them to different versions and scenarios. I like to be sure that I\u2019m satisfied with the original visual concept. If I found out I hate it later, I would be screwed after designing 30 additional screens. Of course, When I look back at my old designs, I can\u2019t say I love them, but I\u2019m sure those were the best pieces I could produce at the time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"626\" src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/uikitFS-1294x791@2x-1024x626.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4126\" srcset=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/uikitFS-1294x791@2x-1024x626.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/uikitFS-1294x791@2x-300x183.jpg 300w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/uikitFS-1294x791@2x-768x469.jpg 768w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/uikitFS-1294x791@2x-1536x939.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/uikitFS-1294x791@2x-2048x1252.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/uikitFS-1294x791@2x-1294x791.jpg 1294w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>What was your first product?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I always try to react to things happening around me. My first product was the Apple Watch UI Kit that I published soon after Apple released the first Apple Watch. Nobody knew what the screen resolutions were going to be, or what patterns will be used but I didn\u2019t care\u2014and it worked. The same happened lately with Webflow where I reacted to their announcement of copy\/paste functionality for the elements between projects. I created a UI kit in Webflow from which people could copy\/paste and create their own versions. That got Webflow interested, we got in touch, and now I\u2019m a part of their design team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>You also lived and worked in London, and now you are based in Prague. Does your current location matter to you as a designer?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>No. The only difference is in the timezones your work in. If you are working with Americans, you have to count with 7 to 9-hour time difference. Now that can influence your workflow, but design-wise it doesn\u2019t matter at all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Design Meetup 03: Jan Losert\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Wx_L9RD2AdM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Jan was the main speaker at our Design Meetup 3 in Ko\u0161ice so I sat with him for a quick chat about his work and set up the mood for his talk about How to succeed as an individual designer selling UI kits.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":4,"featured_media":4113,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":""},"categories":[14],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v16.4 -

First, it\u2019s portable and easy to install. Furthermore, thanks to private browsing and statelessness it\u2019s quite secure (I\u2019d argue it can easily be made more secure than a typical desktop app) and if integrated with a hardware wallet, the security is perfect. Since Cardano <a href=\"https:\/\/inside.vacuumlabs.com\/category\/crypto\">cryptocurrency<\/a> is growing popular and it did not have a similar platform, we decided to take the challenge and start developing our solution for it. It\u2019s called AdaLite and here\u2019s how and why we did it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Daedalus\u2019s Labyrinth<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"626\" src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/labyrinthFull-1294x791@2x-1024x626.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4118\" srcset=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/labyrinthFull-1294x791@2x-1024x626.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/labyrinthFull-1294x791@2x-300x183.jpg 300w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/labyrinthFull-1294x791@2x-768x469.jpg 768w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/labyrinthFull-1294x791@2x-1536x939.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/labyrinthFull-1294x791@2x-2048x1252.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/labyrinthFull-1294x791@2x-1294x791.jpg 1294w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There are currently more than 10,000 .js production files, that the official Daedalus wallet depends on. These are downloaded from the npm registry without any guarantee that they don\u2019t include any malicious code. May any of these dependencies contain a key-logger, which is indeed easily doable, your security is screwed. Of course, this is a common problem of many javascript applications, but it\u2019s especially important here when dealing with money.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>[related_article]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, there are paper wallets for Daedalus, but in general, they may help you only against some almost trivial attacks. Fundamentally, it\u2019s more a quick-fix than a proper solution; a hardware wallet integration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another sad fact is that Daedalus has to store and sync the whole blockchain to work and this is time and disk space consuming.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"626\" src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/content_1_FS-1294x791@2x-1024x626.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4119\" srcset=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/content_1_FS-1294x791@2x-1024x626.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/content_1_FS-1294x791@2x-300x183.jpg 300w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/content_1_FS-1294x791@2x-768x469.jpg 768w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/content_1_FS-1294x791@2x-1536x939.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/content_1_FS-1294x791@2x-2048x1252.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/content_1_FS-1294x791@2x-1294x791.jpg 1294w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>However, we don\u2019t like to complain in vain, so we decided to address those issues by coming up with our own Cardano light wallet implementation. Lacking a precise enough Cardano technical specification, we resorted to reverse-engineering Daedalus\u2019s backend from the Cardano codebase, made mostly in Haskell.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Achieving Security<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Those are the principles we are following to make our light wallet as safe as possible:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Make the project publicly auditable and easy to review<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The source code is available on <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/github.com\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub<\/a>,\n you can review it, build it yourself locally and compare the resulting \nbundle with the one hosted on the site. The most relevant part of the \ncode is around two thousand lines of ES6 JavaScript, which is a lot less\n than the official Cardano implementation of Daedalus and it\u2019s certainly\n more readable for the majority of developers, as opposed to Haskell.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"626\" src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/content_2_FS-1294x791@2x-1024x626.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4120\" srcset=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/content_2_FS-1294x791@2x-1024x626.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/content_2_FS-1294x791@2x-300x183.jpg 300w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/content_2_FS-1294x791@2x-768x469.jpg 768w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/content_2_FS-1294x791@2x-1536x939.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/content_2_FS-1294x791@2x-2048x1252.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/content_2_FS-1294x791@2x-1294x791.jpg 1294w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Keeping compatibility with the official wallet<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We are aware that at any time our wallet may stop working because some breaking change in Cardano might be released. However, since we replicate the way Daedalus is deriving addresses from the passphrase, you can always fall back to it, i.e. recover your wallet from the passphrase.* If the change was breaking even for Daedalus, you can rely on the same instructions that would be provided to its users by the official community; therefore you don\u2019t have to be afraid about being locked out from your funds in such case.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>*to be efficient, we generate the addresses deterministically which is indeed a difference from Daedalus, that does it randomly. However, it\u2019s not a difference that would prevent Daedalus from being able to recover a CardanoLite wallet. It\u2019s a \u201cproblem\u201d only the other way around.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3>Hardware wallet support<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of the day, you cannot rely on the browser nor the dependencies you have or the lack of them when it comes to security.
