# The first and only LGBT+ digital banking platform backed by Vacuumlabs launches in the USA

Today is an important day for the LGBT + community. November 18th, 2020 marks the launch of Daylight, our latest portfolio venture that we’ve been working on the last year. One of the co-founders of Vacuumlabs, [Matej Ftacnik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ftacnik/), is a long term supporter of the LGBT+ community in Slovakia and has been leading the effort to build a new venture in this space for quite some time

As part of our venture-building initiatives, he came up with the idea of a bank that tackles the inherent problems of the LGBT+ community and in early 2020, he brought in the founding team [Rob Curtis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mr-rob-curtis/) and [Billie Simmons](https://www.linkedin.com/in/billiesimmons/) – which has greatly contributed to the business ever since. After a period of intensive support and hands-on collaboration with Matej and the Vacuumlabs venture team, the Daylight team has received the necessary initial funding and technology resources to drive Daylight forward on its own.

Matej continues to be involved as the Chairman of the Board for Daylight. Rob Curtis has said:

> “What we love about Matej is that it took a Slovak activist to take a chance on building a company that would have such an impact on the LGBT+ community in the USA. Ultimately, without him, whatever impact we achieve as a business wouldn’t be possible. And we are excited to work with him on the Board.”

Vacuumlabs acts as the technology partner that is powering the development of Daylight’s digital banking platform alongside Visa and Marqeta.

> “Combining the power of Vacuumlabs’ world-class fintech engineering talent and our knowledge of the LGBT+ community in the US makes this the ideal partnership to build a major bank of affinity that helps LGBT+ people prepare for the future faster,” says Billie Simmons.&nbsp;
