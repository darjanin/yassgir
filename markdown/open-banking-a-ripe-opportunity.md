> “For many years, banks told us how to deal with them. They said, ‘if you’re going to deal with our bank, you’re going to go to our brunch. You’re going to ring our telephone number. You’re going to use our digital channel and you’re gonna use our paperwork.’ “

Those words are from Simon Lyons. He’s the Head of Ecosystem Engagement at the Open Banking Implementation Entity (OBIE), and he recently sat down with us to talk about the revolution occurring right now in banking.&nbsp;

Banking information has traditionally stayed off-limits. Small businesses and digital services have been unable to integrate with accounts in order to provide their customers with improved experiences. But organisations like OBIE are creating new expectations for banks to share data and connect with these services.

Over in the UK, OBIE is producing guidelines and setting software standards in the industry. It’s a road to standardised connections between banks and service providers, which will create faster transactions, easier data-access, and more freedom for both consumers and SMEs.

Small businesses have always dealt with complicated processes around banking, and that’s about to change with open banking.

But is there anyone to blame for the previously lockedbanking system that made life so difficult for SMEs?SMEs? Simon doesn’t think so.&nbsp;

The cost of implementing changes at large banks has been prohibitively expensive. So while OBIE’s guidelines will encourage them, it will also create opportunities for small, agile fintechs to fill the gaps for SMEs and consumers.

> “Open banking is for people who may well get a good banking service. So they can interface with that bank in the way they want. That’s really, really key.” <meta charset="utf-8">– Simon Lyons
