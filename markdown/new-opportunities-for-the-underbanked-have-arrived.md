Do you remember what transactions were like before internet banking? They were expensive, took multiple days to transfer, and had to be done directly from bank branches. But for some communities in 2021, this is still the norm.

Internet banking isn’t available in countries like Nigeria. In addition, families are hit with expensive currency conversion fees whenever they receive money from overseas relatives. Fortunately, companies like SympliFi are bringing change. And we were lucky enough to sit down with its co-founders, Gregoire and Maurice.

> “We really tried to simplify a process that that can be seen as complex” – Gregoire Lecomte

The most moving part of our conversation was Maurice’s personal experience with underbanked. He explained that communities in developing countries experienced tremendous opportunities the moment they were given access to credit.&nbsp;

That inspired SympliFi. Here’s how it works:

- First, a family in Nigeria applies for loan on SympliFi web, which is connected to partnered banks in Nigeria.
- During their application, the family involves a relative in a developed country who acts as their loan guarantor.
- The guarantor receives a notification to download the SympliFi app and top it up with money, which is locked into a digital wallet.
- From here, the Nigerian bank provides a loan to the family, and the guarantor earns interest on the money locked in the wallet (which can stay there for an indefinite time).

> “You have people in the UK providing cash to their family members without ever having to move.” – Maurice&nbsp;Iwunze

The longer the money is locked in the wallet, the more the guarantor can earn. And based on the amount of locked money, the Nigerian bank can even provide multiple loans.

> “It is a really powerful solution that just one collateral can enable your family member to get, one, two, three, or more loans. Whenever they need cash, they can just go to the bank and leverage that same one collateral instead of calling you.” – Maurice Iwunze

A critical point of SympliFi’s mission is providing Nigerian families with independence. Thanks to their system, Nigerian residents are empowered to gradually build a credit history with their bank, unlocking larger loans as needed.
