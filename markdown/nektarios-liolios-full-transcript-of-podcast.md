**Here is the full transcript of podcast episode, enjoy!**

**Nektarios Liolios** **[00:00]&nbsp;**

The financial industry doesn’t do R & D. If you look at health, automotive, any other industry.&nbsp; This is part of who they are, what they do. In financial services, none of this. Maybe a focus group, if you’re lucky. But usually building your products and services is looking at what the competition does and doing it a little bit better. Tweaking it here and there.

**Helene Panzarino** **[00:17]**&nbsp;

Welcome to my first episode of the Vacuumlabs Banking on Air podcast. I’m delighted to say that for my inaugural event, I’m joined by that FinTech fossil that most of the world knows and loves, Nektarios Liolios.

**Nektarios Liolios** **[00:32]**&nbsp;

Does this mean that you’ve undug me under some rock, from under a rock. Hello! Hi, Helene.

**Helene Panzarino** **[00:38]**&nbsp;

Nektarios it is wonderful to be with you on my first day, as it were,&nbsp; on this job. We’ve had other experiences where I’ve been with you on the first day of a job,&nbsp; and we can talk about that a little bit later. But before we get into that, where there might be two people on the whole planet who don’t know who you are, maybe you can introduce yourself as well.

**Nektarios Liolios [00:56]**&nbsp;

Okay. jeez, I spent 17 years of my life in the corporate world in financial services under various guises **.** And then I joined this crazy bunch of innovators called Innotribe, which was a novel, weird movement, more than a company department that was looking to help the wider financial industry to innovate. And that was an eye-opening moment and one of those moments you remember in your life, where there was no going back. Innotribe was visionary. We had the budgets and the freedom to do crazy things, exploratory things, experimental things, at a time when FinTech wasn’t a word. So we actually started educating ourselves and educating the industry about what the new technologies and the new business models would bring and how the industries could benefit from that.

&nbsp;This was at Swift, the messaging network, right? So a community mechanism that had the remit to do something for the community. We started with a conference. We did BizDev in the sense of trying to find the right people within the financial institutions who understood innovation or were in charge of innovation. Usually they didn’t have an innovation title at that time because we’re talking 2009, 2010. And little by little, we started seeing startups and other innovators, and we decided to build a mechanism that connects the two, so we did a competition. Because nobody did it at the time. FinTech, as I said, wasn’t a word. And I always amuse people by telling the story that the first person I hired later for startup bootcamp FinTec, the accelerator, thought that FinTech meant technology from Finland. No joke. Long story short, we did some amazing things with other startup competitions, over three years. So big global mechanisms for some amazing companies in the process.

And then we decided we want to be closer to these startups. We were looking to build the first industry collaborative, industry driven accelerator program for financial services companies. And we wanted to do this in partnership with startup bootcamp as one of the accelerator organizations in Europe with a great reputation. And I ended up switching sides and doing it outside of the industry. And there was the first moment where I stepped into the entrepreneurial world. Started setting up Bootcamp Fintech in London as an industry focused corporate innovation driven accelerator program with a bunch of banks and financial institutions sponsoring it. And then every nine months we would launch a new city around the world, London, Singapore, New York, Mumbai, Mexico City, Dubai . It’s huge. It’s everywhere. So for five years, that was my life. And at the end of 2018, I thought I’ve had enough. So I packed my bags and left.

**Helene Panzarino**** &nbsp; **** [03:38]&nbsp;**

I was very fortunate to have met you in 2014. When I was at Innovate UK, the UK trade body for FinTech, when people were just getting to grips with that new word, FinTech. And kudos to the fintechs and whoever made that up, they should own that. So I was involved with that new FinTech and all of what that would mean in 2014, and I came out of funding for high growth companies, And I consider myself a recovering banker. So we’ve all come at this FinTech thing from different angles and came together again, as you said at Rainmaking or in the next iteration of the accelerator, when we worked together on the Colab. Now, I want to go back to some of the things that you mentioned, because you spoke about community and you spoke about FinTech.

You spoke about corporates and innovation, and that’s something that we came together also to try and see if we could create meaningful commercial engagement for tier ones and the FinTech community. But I have to ask, and I know other people will be wondering too, with all that behind you, with all of the entrepreneurial side of startup bootcamp, with all of that momentum and all of the firsts that you were involved with, what was it that made you decide to step out of it in 2018?

**Nektarios Liolios [04:55]**&nbsp;

There’s the official version, but that’s not what you want to hear. The personal side was, I was tired. I was tired physically. I was tired emotionally building for five years, firefighting for five years, because when you run a small business and we grew the business from 10 people to 20 – 50 people, but still. But ultimately I was tired of the industry. We decided to launch Startupbootcamp FinTech as a program that actually helps the slow moving animals that are the banks to understand the different steps that need to take across the different stages of innovation, trying to get them to understand innovation strategy, the importance of experimentation, but also the importance of commercial engagements and all these things.

But after five years, ultimately after eight years in that space, talking to people in the institutions, looking them in the eye, knowing that they know what the right things to do are, and then seeing that they didn’t want to do them because it was too hard or it wasn’t politically the right thing to do, or because their objectives were different, because they didn’t do this for the cause they did this for themselves and I just got super frustrated. I literally just couldn’t stand having yet another conversation. So everybody says, I know what you’re saying, but we’re not going to do it.

**Helene Panzarino** **[06:08]&nbsp;**

Listening to you, say it again, even though I know I’ve experienced it. And I was reading something in one of the LinkedIn channels where people were saying, “Oh, these are the five things that innovators need to do. And innovation departments need to do this. “And every time you read it, you think we all know what people need to do, but as you’ve just said, they just don’t do it.

And I wonder also, and we’ve had this conversation before about whether or not it’s a tier one or is a tier two, or it’s a lower tier, the lower level of financial services. What happened ultimately was, I think, that&nbsp; the tier ones started to do it for themselves. And then to set up internal accelerators, call them whatever you want to call them – Incubators, accelerators, moonshots, slingshots, navel gazing whatever it might be – thinking that they drunk enough of the Kool-Aid so they could figure out how to do it themselves and they had enough of working with the external providers of these services or being an entrepreneur in residence.

And again, just thinking, ‘we’ve learned enough, we can do it ourselves’. And so they were also thinking, ‘we’ve moved on from that’. And we’re not as responsive, but at the same time I think the fintechs started to grow much more quickly than incumbents ever thought that they would. And they hadn’t crossed that bridge where they could say, ‘they don’t need the crumbs from the table anymore’.

And the fintechs are not waiting for you to give them something. They’ve moved on. And my own feeling was that’s when I got interested in the smaller banks and then the community banks or building societies, and actually the whole idea behind community. And I think that’s something that we’ve explored and we will go on to explore.

I’d like to pick up on that because I said, we spoke about community innovation, financial services, and engagement.

**Nektarios Liolios** **[07:58]&nbsp;**

There is a thing here that is looking back and we can now look over in my case, 10 years of this, right? There is something about banks being binary. It’s either one or the other, a lot of the decisions were being taken. Okay. Oh, we need an innovation lab. Let’s just build one. Not really understanding the purpose, the expected results, what successes. And it happened with pretty much everything. Oh, we need a head of innovation. Let’s just chuck the title innovation to somebody who had a business, this unit role or a biz dev role or corporate development or whatever it is.

The other thing is, because of that binary perspective, when things didn’t work out, people said, okay, we tried this, it didn’t work. Therefore innovation doesn’t work. Add to this, the fact that these things aren’t linear. You cannot predict where it will go. Some of it is, especially when it’s exploration or experimentation, that is just a part of things. Maybe this episode will take longer, but let me give you an example. When we started talking about the importance of startups, we tried to tell people: “You need to learn how to work with these innovators, because you will not be able to come up with these ideas, the business models or the technologies. But for an early stage startup, it’s all going to be learning for you because the startup will not be mature enough to interface, to get through your procurement process.”

So we had this slogan that said from ROI to R & D. Tried to get people to understand, move away from your return on investment mindset and understand that this is going to be research and development money. It’s pure research. And part of it will be useless. And part of it will be the nugget that you need to get to the next stage. And you need to build the capacity, capability, because the financial industry doesn’t do R & D. If you look at health automotive, any other industry.&nbsp; This is part of who they are, what they do. In financial services, none of this. Maybe a focus group, if you’re lucky. But usually building your products and services is looking at what the competition does and doing it a little bit better. Tweaking it here and there.

**Helene Panzarino** **[09:49]&nbsp;**

There’s no budget for failure either to play around with.

**Nektarios Liolios [09:52]**&nbsp;

Yeah, this is all part of R & D right? Now, when we are out in the market with this message, people go: “Oh, we understand, we need to do proof of concept .” And all that they say great. Pilots, proof of concept without an expectation on returns at that stage. Guess what? Five years later you meet the same people going: “We’ve done a hundred POCs” and you go: “And?” And they go: “We’re doing innovation”. No you’re doing the first slice of innovation. But where’s the thinking beyond that, it’s this really naive thinking of, we have to do one thing, tick the box and then move on or expect something to happen.

And this is where the frustration comes in. And it’s very simple, super sophisticated organizations, highly technological organizations, having a very simplistic, naive view on how innovation works. And this is part of the problem. This was part of the reason why I got fed up because people weren’t prepared to do more and the more is deeper, the more is structural, the more has to do with shareholder expectations.

**Helene Panzarino** **[10:49]&nbsp;**

So I’m thinking about how large organizations engage with the FinTech community. So what are the models of engagement and what’s come out of that. You either have people investing in you, you have people acquiring, you have people seeing you as a vendor, then you have someone in partnership that has some of their own agenda and wants to work with you in a certain way. But also we know that there’s a way to work together and have some co-creation. So has that grown up enough now? And is that more driven by the fintechs rather than the incumbents? Is the way that we engage, does that have to change for actually a real commercial engagement to be affected?

And if you don’t engage and genuinely engage in a commercial way with the fintechs to co-create something new, are you at risk of dying out? You’d be like a dinosaur.

**Nektarios Liolios [11:37]**&nbsp;

I haven’t seen it fundamentally evolve. Because you mentioned a few very common ones, right. We could buy a company. We could invest in a company. We could use them as a vendor. It’s all great if you know why you’re doing what you’re doing, but that presumes strategy. And this is the thing that even 10 years down the line, since the emergence of that as a buzz theme, I haven’t seen people understanding innovation strategy.

I haven’t seen organizations which recognize that. In order for this to work, the business needs to be on board. And we built a co-lab together because we’ve recognized that it will start. It has to start with the business seeing the necessity, not some innovation kind of person going: “Oh, this season, I’m interested in blockchain”. And you go: “Why?” And they go: “Because it’s cool. And because we get to travel to Silicon Valley.” Because that’s really it.&nbsp; Reality is, it was of no relevance to the business units.

**Helene Panzarino [12:32]**&nbsp;

They’ve been doing it for 18 months before they moved on to another innovation department. And I say to some of the innovation people, you are lovely people, and I like working with a lot of you, but I didn’t feel it at times. It was a bit like: “Oh, I’m, I’m done here. I’ve attempted the innovation thing. I haven’t had the backing from my organization. I don’t have a space to fail. I don’t have a remit to actually get

something done. So I’m going somewhere else.” There’s shareholder pressure, there’s target pressure in every financial institution.

And it’s just how innovation fits into that. And I think what’s happened here, in the world, the whole idea behind accelerating innovation has really come to the fore. If you don’t have a strategy, you need to get one. If you did have a strategy, a digital strategy, then you really need to get your skates on because COVID has pushed everybody’s digital strategy and transformation to the extreme.

**Nektarios Liolios** **[13:23]**

There are a couple of examples. There are organizations who got a little bit better at it and people trying to copy, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Part of it is also that the startups, the fintechs have matured. But still there’s, I would say, the majority of organizations still don’t really understand how to engage with an early stage company, with the seed stage company, with A series, B series, and the value that they will get out of the different stages, which is still a problem.

If you want to solve a problem, if you have a problem in the business and you look strategically at it and you go, okay, how will I solve this? So if you see a new revenue opportunity, how will I get there? At some point, there needs to be this moment where you think: ” Do I do it myself, or can I partner with somebody who’s already figured it out? And if this part is out in the market, how do I interface with them technologically, but also from a process perspective? My processes, procurement legal compliance, la-di-da set up in a way that I can do this quickly and benefit from the speed that this other company does.” If you bring in people from the relevant departments on board, early on, you will actually get through this easier than if you’ve got the innovation team operating in isolation, then throw it in front of the legal person and they go,’ why should I care?’

So people aren’t incentivized enough to do it. And this hasn’t changed. Some of the procurement processes have changed for early stage experimentation. Yeah. Great. And some banks are better at it, some banks have got this mindset: “We can co-create, let’s put a company that has a solution right next to the business unit for six months, get them to work together on the problem, figuring out the gaps and then get our process people to make sure that we can bridge these gaps.”

Yeah, it works. JP Morgan’s a good example. And there are the companies like Goldman’s who have successfully built startups themselves or bought companies and incorporated the solutions. But the majority don’t understand that the moment you buy a startup, the startup dies because the CEO didn’t set out to be a senior executive in a bank.

They wanted to run a business because usually, in a bizarre way, they wanted to change the world by introducing back office efficiencies or whatever it is. So&nbsp; I don’t think the organizations have figured it out

**Helene Panzarino** **[15:30]&nbsp;**

As I’m listening to you, I’m thinking, and right now we’re in a situation that’s almost mission critical for people to figure out if it’s because of the exposure of the front, middle and back end that occurred with COVID, particularly when it came to SMEs and SMBs.

So depending on where you are in the world, this highlighted the fact that it wasn’t good enough; what was available, wasn’t good enough. And you weren’t going to be able to give somebody the finance that they needed to be available, and to have it ready for them in a way they can consume it.

And somebody else was just going to step into the breach. There’ll be an alternative provider, for example, that will take that space. Is this one of those moments where we can actually say: “Maybe this is the thing that will open the door for people to genuinely understand that they need to undo the learning and to take a different position and see how to really work with the FinTech community to do some good?” We’re all here to do some good. But we have to look into our cultural legacy as much as our tech and our infrastructure legacy and make some changes.

**Nektarios Liolios** **[16:36]**

It’s so difficult to say. For me, it’s baffling then in 2020, we’re talking about: “Oh, maybe SME banking is a space that will be the catalyst.”

And guess what, when we talked in 2014 in the boot camp about what we were looking for, we said: “Look, nobody cares about payments solution anymore, or yet another wallet.” And even alternative lending for consumers was already quite saturated in the mature markets. We saw SME banking as a pioneering space.

This is where the real difference will come in. And we had companies doing great things coming through the accelerator that are now successful players in that space. But the incumbents? Six years down the line, I haven’t seen much.

**Helene Panzarino [17:16]**&nbsp;

So when we talk about incumbents, is there a difference between the tier ones, the tier twos, the tier threes?

Is it big boys and small boys or girls or people? I always feel that the ‘just belows’ have not been tainted yet by the process of going through some kind of innovation theater and thinking that they can do it themselves. And they also have more to risk, more to lose, but potentially more to gain, right?

**Nektarios Liolios** **[****17:46]**

Yeah. If you’re a smaller institution, you have this conundrum of you could be in the loop, but you may not have the same budget as a big one, so you can’t invest as much into one of the expensive players or the experimentation. But if you look at it globally, the banks that are usually a little bit smarter, it’s not the very big names, it’s the ones below, right? It’s interesting also to watch how emerging markets are much better at this than the established markets. And talk about consumer business, everybody will go back at some point and talk about&nbsp; the M-PESA in Kenya. Everybody will talk about micro-lending organizations in Latin America.

But it goes beyond that. And I think it’s really interesting to see how some of the startups that are in&nbsp; the direct consumer space address these markets. I’m Greek, it’s well documented. Revolut has a huge presence in Greece, right? You don’t think about that. You don’t think that they’re one of the bigger players. But they’ve come into a space where, because of the Greek financial crisis and everything there was room to play. I have a feeling that little by little, some of the startups of 10 years ago, who are now unicorns, will start hogging the space. And the banks have probably to some extent given up on the consumer play and they think that with a corporate relationship and everything else, the treasury business, whatever it is, that the business is safe. But ultimately I think little by little, this will be eroded as well. We’ve been saying this for years, people don’t care. It still feels safe. COVID has shaken up things a bit, we don’t really know how this is going to pan out. Nobody would have thought that Zoom would be the standard means of communication seven months down the line. So I think it’s interesting

**Helene Panzarino** **[19:23]**&nbsp;

No, nobody would have thought that PayPal for the over **55s** would be the main way to pay for things, but that’s, what’s happening in COVID. So,&nbsp; the other thing is that big tech has always been there. And it’s been there from the consumer’s point of view and now it’s moving into the business space as well. We always said that the thing that big tech was was the elephant in the room. Banks needed to be afraid of the fintechs as much as they did to be afraid of big tech. And now it’s making its move.

**Nektarios Liolios** **[19:48]**

But you know what, you used PayPal and you talked about it as a startup. And a lot of banks refer&nbsp; to a company like PayPal as a startup. I think of PayPal as an old hat because there’s so many new year’s solutions in the market. But also I’ve got another 15 months until my 55th. So I can do that.

**Helene Panzarino** [20:08]&nbsp;

And I’m already taking 25% of my pension. No, actually that’s fine. &nbsp; We’re asking all our guests to explain, as in that saying, if you could explain something to your grandmother, that means you know it very well. Because we all know there are lots of buzzwords and there are lots of people when they’re talking about AI machine learning, for example, and that they don’t really know what they’re talking about.

They’re just saying anything with AI we know is very, everyone’s talking about right now. So in our first podcast together and then our first podcast under my umbrella, if you had to explain FinTech, successful FinTech corporate engagement, to your grandmother in one minute, what would that sound like?

**Nektarios Liolios** **[20:45]**

You should have prepared me for that question. Now I have to think on my feet. FinTech, corporate engagement?

**Helene Panzarino [20:54]&nbsp;**

Successful.

**Nektarios Liolios**  **&nbsp;**** [20:55]**&nbsp;

Okay. Yeah. The big banks don’t give… No, maybe I should address my grandmother. Dear grandma, Helene. You, this is tricky, Helene, this is tricky. Maybe forget the grandmother. Ultimately corporate startup engagement means that there’s a lot of technology out there that allows us to do amazing things. And the banks don’t really know how to use it, partly because they don’t care about their clients that much and partly because they’re just incapable of actually understanding what new business models are possible based on this technology. Crowdlending, which is something that a lot of people do now, is a business model that’s enabled by new technology. A lot of the things that we see and maybe, sorry, that’s not the right way to answer your question.

But one of the things that really frustrates me in the conversation around FinTech is people get too stuck on the technology piece and blockchain, AI or whatever…it’s ultimately irrelevant ,because the big thing in all of this is that me as a consumer, me as a corporate, me as a small business, I get better financial services.&nbsp; I’ve got problems that have been solved because there’s a new business model that is possible because of the technology. I can get an account open faster. I can get a loan faster. I can prove my credentials for credit score in a better way. Something that reflects my life. I think an easy way to describe this is maybe to go to your grandmother and say, if you were to go to a bank and ask for a loan, the bank would probably send your way because you live on a small pension.

And that’s all there is. And nobody would know dear grand-mama that you’ve got 3 billion, Instagram followers in this episode

**Helene Panzarino [22:30]**&nbsp;

You hid 3 million under your mattress.

**Nektarios Liolios** [22:33]

There you go. So maybe you need to work on that question. I don’t know. The grandmother and FinTech, corporate integration,…

**Helene Panzarino** [22:43]&nbsp;

There’s a lot of FinTech happening in that space. E **lder tech** is the new black. So they ignore the $8 trillion global spends, at their peril. Really? Yeah. I think we definitely overstayed our welcome on this topic.

**Nektarios Liolios** **[22:54]**

Have we? We just started!

**Helene Panzarino** **[22:57]**&nbsp;

No. We’ve obviously overstayed our welcome.

**Nektarios Liolios** **[22:59]**

Do you want to ask me what I’m doing now?

**Helene Panzarino [23:00]**&nbsp;

So I said it’s interesting that we ended on FinTech as the technology of any age, that is the enabler for the things that people want to do in their financial, and in other parts of their life. That’s what FinTech should be, It should be the enabler for what we want to do, whether it was the ATM in 1967, or it was Diners card when your man couldn’t pay his bill and they didn’t take a check, or the other old technologies from the telegraph, the telegram. It goes on and on, and they just enabled people to get on with their lives more simply, at a better cost and with more transparency. And finance was one of the things that they had to do. Somehow we managed to make it something bigger than it was or that it is. So it’s nice that we came back to the fact that technology should be there to enable us to do what we want to do with our financial services and that finance is not the thing that becomes the overriding element. It’s actually what we want to do with it. Thank you so much for being with me.

**Nektarios Liolios** **[****23:59]**

Thank you for having me.

**Helene Panzarino [24:00]**&nbsp;

And it was a wonderful way to kick off. Thank you to everyone who’s been listening and who joined us. We’ll see you on our next podcast.
