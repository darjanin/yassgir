[Mathias Wikström](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathiasw1/), CEO of [Doconomy](https://doconomy.com/), and [Johan Pihl](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johan-pihl-b579722/), Head of Innovation & Founder of Doconomy, were the latest guests of our host Marcel Klimo in podcast&nbsp; Banking on Air. At Vacuumlabs, we had an opportunity to partner with Doconomy on the development of their [2030 Calculator](https://www.2030calculator.com/) – a calculator that determines the carbon impact of every purchase. A product that we believe will help to support Doconomy’s powerful vision: to give both consumers and businesses the digital tools that they need to understand and reduce the environmental impact of their consumption. Doconomy is reshaping the way bank cards are used. Their Black Card is the first credit card to limit spending not on available credit, but on the levels of CO2 emission caused by the owner’s purchases.

Do you want to find out more not only about Doconomy’s banking services, but also about the unconventional way of reaching their long-term goal of a more sustainable planet?
