Being a black American in the US and experiencing how underserved this community is, not only from an education or employment point of view but also from a financial one, was for [Donald Hawkins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/donald-j-hawkins/) a starting gear for filling the gap in the market.

He could see how the community lacked financial literacy; they didn’t understand how wealth building and money itself worked. Donald decided to make a change. To do this, he established the first neobank for black Americans, Boulevard, to meet the needs of the community. And this was an inherently inclusive initiative; every community is welcome to use Boulevard’s services, regardless of race or color.

In the 2nd episode of Banking on Air with Helene Panzarino, Donald Hawkins talks not only about systematic oppression of black Americans: he talks about the necessity of community banks and importance of the relationship between banks and customers. With the world changing, particularly due to the impact of COVID-19, everything is happening virtually.

In fact, it’s fair to say that traditional banking isn’t possible anymore. In the past, banks were more transactional than relationship-oriented; but a saturated market requires more than good features. Banks need to keep up with generation Z to be able to survive and not be eaten by their competitors.

Easier to be said than done?
