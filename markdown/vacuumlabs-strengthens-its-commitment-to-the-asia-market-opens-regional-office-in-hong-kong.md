# Vacuumlabs strengthens its commitment to the Asia market. Opens regional office in Hong Kong

Over the past few years, Central Europe based Vacuumlabs has been diligently working on a number of technologically innovative Fintech projects in Asia. From being the [first to implement Thought Machine in Asia](https://resources.vacuumlabs.com/thought-machine-paper) as the foundation for one of the first virtual banks in Hong Kong, to creating cryptocurrency on a new blockchain technology, Vacuumlabs is well positioned to challenge its teams of highly qualified engineers and developers to push the boundaries of software development.

This summer, Vacuumlabs proudly [announced](http://www.sparq.cc/blog/vacuumlabs-to-expand-in-asia-with-a-new-regional-headquarters-in-hong-kong) its partnership with Sparq Capital in Hong Kong. When the executive team first met [Michael Bruck](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelbruck/) at the Hong Kong Fintech Week in 2019, we immediately “clicked” and started discussing how to work together to strengthen Vacuumlabs’s presence in the region and be closer to the leading Fintech innovation taking place in Asia, as well as be able to provide better support to our partners, from startups and scaleups to corporates. Michael and Donna will guide the company’s strategy to grow sales and partnerships in the APAC region.

Today, we are excited to announce that our Asia Headquarters office in Hong Kong is now open. Located in the trendy and up-and-coming Wong Chuk Hang neighborhood, with its rapidly growing community of startups at [WHub](https://www.whub.io/), [Campfire](https://campfire.co/work/wong-chuk-hang/), and the Peninsula Group’s [Kaleidoscope Labs](https://www.hshgroup.com/en/about/kaleidoscope-lab). Vacuumlabs Asia has taken a large office space able to host talks and events for the local Fintech community.

We are open for business and can’t wait to welcome you to come to visit us soon!
