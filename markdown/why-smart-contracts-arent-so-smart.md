After a basic introduction to the crypto world and an explanation of its most-used terms, we are here again for a second crypto episode! [David Stancel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidstancel/?originalSubdomain=at), our cryptocurrency expert here at Vacuumlabs, and CTO at Fumbi, returned to join _Banking on Air_ host Helene Panzarino. This time, they focused on smart contracts, Ethereum, and platform interoperability.

**To start with, what exactly is a smart contract?&nbsp;**

> “A smart contract is an application(a piece of code) that runs simultaneously on thousands of computers on a decentralized network. Anybody can join and participate in the network by running these applications. However once they are deployed on the network, it is almost impossible to remove them, stop them or tamper with the code. This is a unique trait of crypto and blockchain.” – David Stancel

And, as mentioned in our first episode, **this is one of the main reasons why crypto and blockchain were created**.

Where then, can smart contracts be used? Mainly, they are applied in financial services (DeFi – decentralized finance, exchanges, lending platforms,…), but also in the logistics, trade, and&nbsp; healthcare industries.&nbsp; Smart contracts run on blockchain networks like Ethereum, which is a decentralized, open-source blockchain.

> “The Ethereum network stole the show by enabling developers to write “smart contracts”. While this was&nbsp; also possible on Bitcoin, it was in a very limited way.” – David Stancel

However, using the name “smart contracts” wasn’t the best choice. It turns out that they aren’t so smart after all.&nbsp;

> “It’s because of their architecture. These kinds of programs are just a regular piece of software. The more accurate term would be “persistent scripts”, because they are deployed on decentralized architecture which is censorship-resistant.” – David Stancel

As already emphasized, it is almost impossible to change the code on blockchain, which prevents contracts from being interfered with.

Of course, Ethereum has lots of competitors – many new platforms are being created that are able to replicate the Ethereum virtual machine. In some cases, it is easy enough to transfer from one platform to another, using the same smart contract. But what is still questionable is interoperability – platforms still require third parties, so-called bridges, to enable communication with each other. According to David, we have approximately two years to wait until platforms will be connected in a way that won’t require third parties to be involved.
