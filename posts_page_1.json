And yet, open banking is proof that it\u2019s possible: since open banking APIs launched in October 2018, they have supercharged the innovation of financial services across Europe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Open banking APIs mean that banking data is no longer hidden inside proprietary systems. Now, with a customer\u2019s consent, authorized third-party vendors can access and make use of that banking data to develop service offerings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we will explore how open banking came to be, explore the variety of places its impact can already be seen, and look at further improvement opportunities. But all that starts with a short history lesson \u2014 like any overnight success, the open banking revolution was a long time in the making.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>A short history of open banking<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While its true origins date back to German banking <a href=\"https:\/\/knowledge.fintecsystems.com\/en\/blog\/the-history-of-open-banking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">experiments in the 80s<\/a>, the concept of open banking gained real momentum with the arrival of the internet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 21st century\u2019s first years saw the introduction of online payments and increasing possibilities for once siloed systems to communicate online via \u201capplication programming interfaces\u201d, or APIs. At least in principle, the idea of openly sharing banking data became feasible and realistic.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to facilitate an environment of open competition, the European Commission published the first Payment Services Directive \u2014 PSD1 \u2014 in 2007. Then, in 2015, the European Commission superseded it with a second directive called PSD2.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>PSD2 is effectively responsible for open banking\u2019s current form: it made it <em>mandatory<\/em> for banks to provide programmatic access to the core building blocks of retail and small business banking operations. Upon a customer\u2019s request, banks <em>must<\/em> share account data, transaction data, and allow the ability to initiate payments. Banking data has been set free.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through PSD2, the European Commission was not only encouraging but <em>mandating<\/em> banks to unlock customer data from their proprietary systems and make it accessible to authorized third-party service providers.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rest is history. Open banking had kicked off by the end of 2018 and stimulated an even faster rate of financial services innovation, along with ever-growing FinTech investments. Newborn third-party services could now reliably build their business models around open access to once proprietary banking data. Also between incumbent banks, new possibilities for collaboration and innovation opened up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The FinTech revolution, that had already driven more banking innovation than had been seen in decades, was accelerated even further.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Many modern fintech successes would not be possible without open banking standards<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Open banking APIs enable a wealth of new financial services that weren\u2019t possible or practical beforehand. Let\u2019s explore a few examples to get a sense of what is now possible and has already been built:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1.

Both ambitious new fintech startups and incumbent banks alike are still exploring how to best make use of their newfound abilities.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To date, open banking has successfully opened up data and transferred its ownership to customers. But will it deliver on its ultimate mission to stimulate competition in the financial services industry? That\u2019s yet to be seen. The current PSD2 directive has been focused on relatively basic data sets of account and transaction data for customer and business accounts, but potentially much more data could be opened up. While European banks follow the PSD2 directive, other regions have seen their own versions of open banking. Almost certainly, PSD2 is not the end of the European open banking story quite yet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Curious to learn more about open banking?

But for some communities in 2021, this is still the norm.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Internet banking isn\u2019t available in countries like Nigeria. In addition, families are hit with expensive currency conversion fees whenever they receive money from overseas relatives. Fortunately, companies like SympliFi are bringing change. And we were lucky enough to sit down with its co-founders, Gregoire and Maurice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cWe really tried to simplify a process that that can be seen as complex\u201d &#8211; Gregoire Lecomte<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The most moving part of our conversation was Maurice\u2019s personal experience with underbanked. He explained that communities in developing countries experienced tremendous opportunities the moment they were given access to credit.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That inspired SympliFi. Here\u2019s how it works:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>First, a family in Nigeria applies for loan on SympliFi web, which is connected to partnered banks in Nigeria.<\/li><li>During their application, the family involves a relative in a developed country who acts as their loan guarantor.<\/li><li>The guarantor receives a notification to download the SympliFi app and top it up with money, which is locked into a digital wallet.<\/li><li>From here, the Nigerian bank provides a loan to the family, and the guarantor earns interest on the money locked in the wallet (which can stay there for an indefinite time).<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cYou have people in the UK providing cash to their family members without ever having to move.\u201d &#8211; Maurice\u00a0Iwunze<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The longer the money is locked in the wallet, the more the guarantor can earn. And based on the amount of locked money, the Nigerian bank can even provide multiple loans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cIt is a really powerful solution that just one collateral can enable your family member to get, one, two, three, or more loans. Whenever they need cash, they can just go to the bank and leverage that same one collateral instead of calling you.\u201d &#8211; Maurice Iwunze<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>A critical point of SympliFi\u2019s mission is providing Nigerian families with independence. Thanks to their system, Nigerian residents are empowered to gradually build a credit history with their bank, unlocking larger loans as needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to hear more about SympliFi and its co-founders, our latest episode of Banking on Air is waiting for you. <meta charset=\"utf-8\">You can listen to it on Apple Podcasts, Breaker, Google Podcasts, Overcast, Pocket Casts, Spotify or here:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"post__player player\"><iframe border=\"0\" class=\"player__iframe\" src=\"https:\/\/anchor.fm\/insidethevacuum\/embed\/episodes\/37-Simplifying-banking-with-Maurice-Iwunze--Gregoire-Lecomte-SympliFi-e161p2l\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" scrolling=\"no\" frameBorder=\"0\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n\n\n\t\n\t<div id=\"podcast-subscribe-button-3988\" class=\"secondline-psb-radius-style\">\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n<div class=\"secondline-psb-subscribe-icons\" style=\"margin-top:-2em;margin-bottom:1em;\"><strong>WHERE TO LISTEN<\/strong> &nbsp;

I&#8217;m your host Helene Panzarino and today we&#8217;re going to be delving deeply into remittances, the world of cross-border payments and powering those along the way. And how we can also help those who are maybe not as banked, unbanked and a little bit of financial inclusion. I&#8217;m never alone on the podcast obviously. I&#8217;ve got some great guests today. CEO and co-founders of SimpliFi are with me. So before we get stuck in to the meat of the matter, how about a couple of introductions? Maurice would you like to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:40] <strong>Maurice Iwunze:<\/strong> Yeah, absolutely. Thanks, Helene for having us on the show. I&#8217;m Maurice Iwunze, I&#8217;m the CEO and co-founder of SimpliFi<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:48] <strong>Gregoire Lecomte:<\/strong> Thank you Helene. And so I&#8217;m Gregoire Lecomte. COO and co-founder of SimpliFi.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:53] <strong>Helene Panzarino:<\/strong> Thank you very much both of you. And I&#8217;d like to get a little bit further into your background. So once we start unpacking a bit about SimpliFi. So I read SimpliFi was founded with one goal in mind to empower diaspora around the world to build prosperity in their home country. Firstly, I need to ask you why you felt the need to do this and then secondly, I want to get into how that actually takes place? So let&#8217;s start with the why. Maurice, what were you doing before this, that suddenly made you realize that this was something that you had to stop and do?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:22] <strong>Maurice Iwunze:<\/strong> Absolutely. So I think there&#8217;s two driving factors, one personal and one professional. As a Nigerian American, my parents migrated to the States late sixties, your typical immigrant story. Not a lot of money growing up and constantly had to watch my parents even to this day, struggle with this financial obligation of having to send money back home, to support family members and people in the community in Nigeria. And we saw this growing up, seeing this constant struggle around it., I always wanted to figure out, is there a better way that we can help the millions of immigrants like my family, like my parents, support their family members back home without this constant burden and need to send money? Are there other financial products that we could provide this customer base that gets the job done back home without sending money across borders? And so that was the personal motivation to start it. And from a professional standpoint, as I invest in my financial services career, had the pleasure to work with Gregoireare at a company called Baobab group that owned and operated one of them, the largest portfolios of microfinance banks across Africa and China. And in our experience, seeing the power of access to credit and financial inclusion in developing countries and now that unlocks massive financial opportunities for the borrowers, we had this thesis and idea that if we can leverage the resources of immigrants of diaspora abroad to enable their family members to access credit, instead of sending money, could that be a more powerful and more impactful solution for both sides of the equation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:57] <strong>Helene Panzarino:<\/strong> Thank you, quick I want to come to you to pick up on something that was just said, so enable their family members to access credits as opposed to sending, just sending money. Because of course, many of us know from a pure remittance market, which is huge as a global market, that people are supporting their families at home, sending money home all the time. Possibly paying high fees for that both ends potentially using the human being involved in an agent situation where we&#8217;re increased for financial crime or for money laundering and all the other parts of the equation that come with that. So can we dig a bit deeper into that? So you both came together, you saw a microfinance. What&#8217;s the difference to a straight remittance?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:40] <strong>Gregoire Lecomte:<\/strong> So the main difference is that they no money sent. So what we are saying in a value proposition is that there is about 25 to 30% of the total volume of remittances that should present 150 billion per annum. 50 cent for business purposes because the receiver in country cannot access credit. Banks don&#8217;t lend in that country and therefore the center to people from the diaspora based in Europe, UK or US they have to play the role of the bank because their relative don&#8217;t access credit. And this is what we say at SimpliFi, we say, don&#8217;t send money, if you top up you SimpliFi wallet with that money, this money is going to be a digital collateral so that your relatives can access credit on these own, and this is what we are doing. We are opening these virtual circuit of building financial independence that you don&#8217;t always have to call someone abroad because you can not access credit. And once you put the foot in door to credit, then yeah. Then you can be financially independent and not always rely on the financial of other people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:45] <strong>Helene Panzarino:<\/strong> Okay. Maurice can you tell me, so I listened, you were saying there&#8217;s a wallet, there&#8217;s digital collateral and we&#8217;re not sending money. So walk me through the steps. If I want to empower one of my relatives and I&#8217;m on the other end, then I want to get the loan. What are the steps who&#8217;s involved in the chain and actually where we&#8217;re doing it? Which countries are we doing then?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:03] <strong>Maurice Iwunze:<\/strong> Yeah. So we started with the UK to Nigeria corridor and the way that our business works is that we partner with banks in the home country. So Nigeria to start with, and they&#8217;re the ones that actually issue in a loan. So they leverage our platform to be able to issue a loan to borrowers locally in Nigeria with the back end of their family members abroad. So how the process will work is that it&#8217;s completely fully digital, support to say that. The borrower in Nigeria, who has a family member abroad, that they traditionally would ask for money, they will go onto our website and apply for a loan. With one of our lending partners in submitting this really short application, they provide us the details, just the name and mobile phone number of the family member in Europe or US that wants to back them on the loan. They submit a request online. Their family member that they&#8217;ve designated as a guarantor, we received the request, they download the SimpliFi app and the SimpliFi app has a digital wallet. So what they would do is they top up their SimpliFi wallet for the amount of the required collateral for the loan. So it&#8217;s usually the amount that they would normally send. They top that in their wallet, lock it and once it&#8217;s locked, the bank in Nigeria is notified. They instantly dispersed the loan to the borrower in Nigeria. So in this process, you potentially can go from the borrower submitting a loan application to their family member, instantly getting a low interest loan in Nigeria, potentially in a matter of minutes or hours. And the money that&#8217;s locked in their collateral they re-pay them a small cash back reward on it as well. So instead of paying costly transfers, they actually make money from helping their family member access credit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:39] <strong>Helene Panzarino:<\/strong> So it was the wallet in essence is like an escrow account, but with cashback on it. Presumably it doesn&#8217;t move unless somebody defaults or until it&#8217;s refunded back once the loan is repaid.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:50] <strong>Maurice Iwunze:<\/strong> Exactly. So the money sits in the wallet and they earn interest on it for the duration of the loan. And while they&#8217;re earning interest in the form of cashback on the money in their wallet, their family member can use it for continuous access to credit. So duly powerful about solution is just one collateral can enable your family member to get 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 loans. Like anytime they need cash, instead of calling you, they can just go to the bank and leverage that same one collateral.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:16] <strong>Helene Panzarino:<\/strong> And so, and I&#8217;m leaving it there because I&#8217;m earning on that money. And presumably the amount that I&#8217;m leaving in there is we&#8217;ve determined that it&#8217;s something that I can afford to do in case there is a default, for example, or it can come out of my daily workings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:30] <strong>Maurice Iwunze:<\/strong> Exactly, exactly, exactly. And so in the event of default, what happens is that we would, whatever&#8217;s owed to the bank. The bank makes best efforts to collect on the loan from the borrower and in event that they&#8217;re not able to collect on their loan. That&#8217;s the only time that you capture the money from the collateral. And then we permit it to the bank, but a vast majority of our customers repay their loan. So you basically have people currently in the UK that are able to provide their family members, constant access to cash without them ever having to move.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:03] <strong>Helene Panzarino:<\/strong> I&#8217;m actually sitting here thinking firstly, about, okay, so, you know, great ideas have sent down to like 10 people at one time, he who moves fastest solution it gets to that market first. But why has it taken so long for you, for someone, to think about this is pretty like, it is really life-changing stuff. For the person on the other end, presumably they don&#8217;t necessarily have to have a bank account with that bank so that they&#8217;re able to create some kind of credit rating credit history building up on the repayment. Right. Okay. I&#8217;m not having to use anything that&#8217;s expensive in between time as the person who&#8217;s sending the money. I can trust because it&#8217;s sitting in that account where it&#8217;s earning money and again, I&#8217;d go back to on the regulation side. It&#8217;s all in the regulated entity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:49] <strong>Maurice Iwunze:<\/strong> ..And you see it, you see it in your wallet. So, and then we always say like, it&#8217;s this opportunity for you just to keep their money to hold onto their money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:58] <strong>Helene Panzarino:<\/strong> And I&#8217;ve got to say, I mean, okay, so you guys are working in it before. You mentioned the technology and the platform and that it&#8217;s all digital and I want to come back to some of the technology and what that feels like and looks like. But again, I&#8217;m sitting here going, how did you come to this. You know, those moments where you think, well, the simplest thing in life is usually the thing that is the house the most impact. We both sitting there one day thinking, hang on a second. This has been all upside down and all wrong because I know you were working together before you met each other through work, but this is pretty powerful stuff. So what was that light bulb moment?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:28] <strong>Maurice Iwunze:<\/strong> The light bulb moment for us was when we were on a business trip visiting one of our, the banks, one of the banks we owned in Africa and the banks we owned an Africa also serve as Western union agents. So it&#8217;s where people go to pick up their remittances. And we&#8217;re seeing the long line of people waiting in line in our branches to pick up the remittances. And we realized that a vast majority of the people that were waiting in line to pick up money from our banks would not be credit worthy enough to get a loan from our bank. And if you ask the CEOs of all the banks we own in Africa, who&#8217;s your biggest clients. They&#8217;ll tell you their biggest client does about 50 to a hundred thousand dollar credit facility on a regular basis. And they&#8217;ll all tell you that client started with a loan of just a couple hundred dollars. And if you look at the average amount of size of remittances that people are picking up from our branches, it&#8217;s a couple of hundred dollars. And so that was the light bulb moment for us was that instead of sending that money, can&#8217;t they just leverage it to get, to start building credit history and start getting a loan from one of our banks. So they can become one of those 50-100 thousand dollar clients of ours. And they will never have to ask their family members for money again. That was the light bulb moment for us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:39] <strong>Helene Panzarino:<\/strong> Amazing. Amazing. And is the technology, is it complex? Was it difficult to put it all together? You know, sometimes people say, oh, it&#8217;s something&#8217;s AI driven and something, something something&#8217;s an algorithm. I think both of those technologies are older than me and that&#8217;s going far. So, but they&#8217;ve presented. It&#8217;s not often that happens. I gotta be honest. But they&#8217;ve been presented as something that&#8217;s brand new, shiny technology. It&#8217;s just that it&#8217;s all been packaged up in a different way. And a lot of the time let&#8217;s face it. It&#8217;s a different distribution channel. It&#8217;s nothing that&#8217;s really. You know, earth shattering. So fill us in a little bit on the technology and how that works.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:16] <strong>Gregoire Lecomte:<\/strong> It&#8217;s always to who you ask the question to. So if you ask to back in engineering will tell you that it&#8217;s not deep technology. However, there is a very high level of complexity into the business logic because you need to connect the bull horn in Nigeria, regulatory microfinance bank or bank in Nigeria with someone in the UK and everything has to be as simple as possible. And we have these basically three clicks logic that we always have in mind that you have to be able to do any transaction in less than three clicks. We really want to make the experience for the users as simple as possible, similar so that he doesn&#8217;t see that behind these dairies. There is a lot of logic and complexity. And so this is really what we have been trying to do. And so far quite successfully is that it looks super simple. This is also why we know we came up with the company name SimpliFi that we really tried to simplify a process that can be seen as complex to something that anyone can do quickly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:19] <strong>Helene Panzarino:<\/strong> Understood. And I, if I&#8217;m on the receiving end, obviously I need to have the phone, presumably, in this instances, it&#8217;s mostly done on phones on smartphone enabled phones because we have the wallet in the phone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:32] <strong>Gregoire Lecomte:<\/strong> So, if you&#8217;re on the receiving side, our mobile app is used only for the sending site for the guarantor. The people in Nigeria he&#8217;s dealing directly with the bank doesn&#8217;t need to go to any branch. The process is fully digital. So sometimes it can be on his mobile wallet or on his bank account. For the receiver here, the one who decides what is the best way for him to get the money,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:25] <strong>Helene Panzarino:<\/strong> Okay. And actually, I suppose, in some ways I know that not everywhere in the world, and I know we&#8217;ll look at some of the countries that we&#8217;re in. We spoke about Nigeria, but you&#8217;re in other countries as well. There were phones and not always smartphones, but there are now initiatives on the way to get phones at a low cost out to people so that people can be connected to the networks and make it that much easier. I think sometimes we forget that although we have a lot of penetration, we don&#8217;t always have smartphone penetration as well, depending on where we are in the world. We always say this and you said it before, Gregoire well, when it&#8217;s something is complicated, but it looks really simple. That&#8217;s the ultimate, isn&#8217;t it right? That&#8217;s making something look simple is the sign of something that has depth to it, obviously, but you don&#8217;t want people on the end to see that necessarily. You just want them to have the three clicks through the process. Digital to digital is the whole journey and the receiver and the sender can experience that in such a short period of time. I love the fact that the bank is involved, but in a meaningful way where, and we&#8217;re not having to go to things like payday lenders anymore, or the, you know, yielded traditional loan shark, or anything like that. Because I think like you Maurice, my relationship with money was formed when I was a child and I saw my family struggling and my background meant that it was always a little bit. Well, there were a lot of questionable moments there and you do want, you think, well, how can I help that community not have to do that anymore, but we&#8217;ve been going on in this way for such a long time. And we&#8217;ve spoken about remittances corridors around the world for such a long time doing it the same way that I&#8217;m literally blown away by the fact that suddenly, met you guys and realize that there&#8217;s another way to do it. Gregoire you mentioned that it&#8217;s been successful so far. Maybe we can talk a little bit about some of the successes. So what does success been looking like? We&#8217;ll talk about some of the challenges as well, but how has success been along the journey?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:13] <strong>Gregoire Lecomte:<\/strong> No, so far as successes that we started on the web-based platform, to validate the proof of concept last year, 2020 in March. And you know, it was the exact same time that COVID arrived and every country locked down. This is really where we had traction started. And the reason why is that while most of the bank in Nigeria stopped lending, because of the lockdown, our financial patterns were the only one who continue lending and continue supporting the clients because they were able to access cash collateral from someone abroad, which means the loan was in the sense that you risk. And they were also able to do this process completely digitally. And from this we have been growing even users and also not to be grading through the mobile app. It is going to really go allowing us to go faster in a product.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:04] <strong>Helene Panzarino:<\/strong> I think people were thinking that people would not be sending as much money abroad during the pandemic, but in fact it really didn&#8217;t happen, did it? I mean, it was, there might&#8217;ve been slight dips, but there were still people sending or wanting to send money or get money to other people during the whole of the pandemic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:20] <strong>Maurice Iwunze:<\/strong> Yeah. So the remittance, it varies by markets. I think some countries are a slight dip, but the dips weren&#8217;t as significant as I think maybe people forecast it. But I think overall, they might&#8217;ve been a little bit. I think what was valuable for our customer base during that period was that it almost on the traditional sense side or guarantor side, the economic downturn affected them as well. I think it was a realization that when there&#8217;s an economic shock and I either lost my job, I&#8217;ve been furloughed, right, where am I going to get the money to support people back home? If I don&#8217;t have a job or my income gets significantly reduced. So from the feedback we&#8217;ve received from customers, part of what drove that traction at that time was that realization. So our customers saw the value in being able to help their family members, but at the same time, reduce this dependence that they had gained over the years and enabled them to start learning how to access money on their own. And at the same time, being able to save their own cachflow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:19] <strong>Helene Panzarino:<\/strong> And I would imagine that by having that pot of money there, that you can reuse or recycle. The guilt was not there. If you felt like you couldn&#8217;t keep sending money, right? This solution takes that away because you know, as long as it&#8217;s there, you don&#8217;t have to keep coming up with it. If you&#8217;re in a situation like you were in furlough, or you lost your job. As long as you can leave it there, then you know, it&#8217;s still gonna do the thing you want it to do, right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:41] <strong>Maurice Iwunze:<\/strong> Exactly. Exactly. One of our customers in the UK, went from avoiding messages and phone calls from a particular family member in Nigeria, because during COVID they lost their job and I can&#8217;t send you money. I don&#8217;t want to tell you I&#8217;m not working right now. And so it wasn&#8217;t until they found out solution that are like okay, this makes more sense for my financial needs or my financial situation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:06] <strong>Helene Panzarino:<\/strong> Fantastic. I think, I mean, obviously these successes on an individual basis and you&#8217;ve had success as well. And I want to talk about the insurance in a little bit also, but you&#8217;ve been on the Techstars program, haven&#8217;t you? As well, there was that part of this last year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:18] <strong>Gregoire Lecomte:<\/strong> Yeah. So we did Toby. We completed textiles baleen during the, for instance, second quarter of the years was 13 weeks of intense program. Being able to access mentors, being challenged of what we do, accelerate our roadmap. Yeah. It was an extremely valuable experience. We learned a lot and really helped us to be on the right track, to continue the growth and accelerate whether we want to be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:43] <strong>Helene Panzarino:<\/strong> And I think that second part of it as well, hopefully that is like the springboard into, and I would love to talk to you about where you&#8217;re going, future jurisdictions, countries and other products. I want to come back to the, I mentioned insurance. So you&#8217;ve got other partnerships, haven&#8217;t you? There&#8217;s a UN partnership and there&#8217;s an insurance partnership as well. So maybe Maurice you can tell me a little bit about the insurance side.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:04] <strong>Maurice Iwunze:<\/strong> Absolutely. So we signed a partnership with AXA. So obviously I&#8217;m sure most people are familiar with AXA, leading global insurance and, investment management company. And so access has been looking for ways to increase insurance penetration in developing countries and understand that the dynamic that in these countries, when there&#8217;s a medical emergency, 99% of people don&#8217;t have insurance to cover any medical emergency. So their family members abroad, ended up filling this insurance gap through sending money to cover unexpected medical emergencies. And so we realized that if we can enable the traditional center to also provide their family members, people in their community, health insurance, that will also reduce that financial burden on them as well. And so we partnered with AXA for this first of its kind solution that bundles health insurance coverage with our loan product. So any customer that gets a loan through us, we&#8217;ll also get automatically medical insurance coverage for the duration of that loan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:07] <strong>Helene Panzarino:<\/strong> Amazing. You know, and as I&#8217;m listening to you speak, I&#8217;m thinking about, you know, people talk all the time about poverty and health being linked, right? And people talk about it and we usually talk about it in terms of vaccination programs and education programs, but for something that&#8217;s in financial services to actually be moving the needle significantly, by doing something practical, that links health and financial wellbeing. Again I&#8217;m sitting here thinking he was likea series of firsts, right? That I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m hearing with you guys. And actually everybody listened because this is groundbreaking stuff. Really just I&#8217;m literally, I&#8217;m blown away. Now, of course, we can&#8217;t always speak about the UN this is like people saying in, I&#8217;ve been to down the street today or up into the white house, but we&#8217;ve been to the UN as well, right? So what&#8217;s happening with the UN because that&#8217;s another thing that doesn&#8217;t just fall into peoples lives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:06] <strong>Gregoire Lecomte:<\/strong> Yeah. So the United nation capital development fund there, they launched a request for proposal last year, right after COVID to be able to partners and support innovative initiatives that will better helps my grants to use the money they have and visit identity solutions to sending money. And so we applied to it and we got accepted to the program. So we are, I think the youngest company that I know that have been enrolled in the program. And so part of their partnership, they are helping us in our expansion that will be starting by Senegal. They also help us with regulatory advice, partnerships, best practices, as well as client education. So, so far we had been working with them on a regular basis. Yeah, this partnership has been really instrumental in our journey for the past seven, eight months with them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:00] <strong>Helene Panzarino:<\/strong> So much has happened in a short space of time. And actually, so one of the things you mentioned is regulation, has that been one of the challenges in the journey or is it not as complicated as we might think?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:10] <strong>Maurice Iwunze:<\/strong> So initially it was, so we being the first to ever do this. We basically have been laying the groundwork to get buy in from all the key stakeholders in the value chain. And so obviously being a FinTech company in the regulation was really the first box we have to check. So we went through an eight month review process with the UK financial regulator. They did extensive evaluation about business model and determined that for our current, our model, we did not need any regulatory permission. So we received a no objection letter for them to operate our model. On the borrower side we only work with regulated banking partners that we also do a KYB check on and fed in before we worked with them as well. So the loans are being issued in all country from those regulated entities. So the beauty about our business model is that since we don&#8217;t have any onerous regulatory constraints or considerations, where we can easily enter new markets with partners.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:04] <strong>Helene Panzarino:<\/strong> Because you are not the one that&#8217;s lending the money and you&#8217;re just there holding it in the back. Okay. Yeah. As well, I&#8217;m sitting here thinking, okay, if I&#8217;m one of the large remittance companies, am I knocking on your door or somebody knocking on your door, they should be knocking on your door right? People should be thinking about, I&#8217;m going to conversation with you as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:23] <strong>Maurice Iwunze:<\/strong> We built the product and our business model to be complimentary to the broader financial ecosystem. So companies that may view us as competitors today, we believe there&#8217;s a perfect synergies for us to collaborate in the future. And that was intentionally done. We see ourselves as an enabler to drive additional digital financial products in the market. The remittance companies historically only had one product to deliver to customers. And so what we&#8217;re just doing is unlocking new digital financial products that can be delivered to that customer base.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:59] <strong>Helene Panzarino:<\/strong> I&#8217;m almost speechless. I keep, as you talk my mind, I could see my mind going around and I&#8217;m trying to processing everything going around. So, oh gosh. And so much has happened in such a short period of time. So if we were sitting here for example, in another year, where would we be? Where would you be? Where SimpliFi going in another year from now? What can we expect in either of you feel free to jump in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:19] <strong>Maurice Iwunze:<\/strong> Yeah. So for the next year, we&#8217;re going to be focusing on growing our business and two home countries in Nigeria and Senegal. But we were going to get to a point where the Nigerians and Senegalese will be able to access credit using a family of friend anywhere across the globe. So right now we&#8217;re just in the UK and Nigeria, but we&#8217;re just in the UK from the guarantor side, but we will be covering broader geographies, over the next 12 months. And on the lending side, we really see ourselves as a conduit to enable new forms of digital lending in host countries where credit penetration is low, that drives increased access to credit, to improve people&#8217;s livelihoods. We see a scenario where we&#8217;re working with a multitude of partners that are doing really innovative solutions around enabling financial services, enabling credit and us partnering with them to help us celebrate that digital lending proposition for borrowers on the home countryside and on the guarantor side for us, it&#8217;s about constantly developing products that reduces the need to send money across borders. So for us credit was the first inroads into that with layer in insurance on top of that. And we&#8217;re going to continue to layer in and add new products to our product stack all around this mission of let&#8217;s solve the job you&#8217;re trying to do back home, but without you having to send money across borders to do it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:42] <strong>Helene Panzarino:<\/strong> Honestly every time you say it, I keep thinking, I know what we&#8217;re talking about, but I still can&#8217;t believe that firstly, that you guys saw it and you did it and obviously that we&#8217;re doing it now. And when you say it, it&#8217;s so obvious, right. But it&#8217;s been such a challenging space for so many people for so long. And this is just like the perfect use of all the different parts of financial services and technology to make something amazing happen. True, I never say very rarely can we say that in financial services and FinTech that it is life-changing, but I think this is life changing. Obviously on the recipient side, but also I think I can understand the mind of the person who&#8217;s sending the money as well. This is super great beliefs of their weight, of their shoulders, really, to be able to do this using technology and to be earning money on it as well. So that everyone benefits. I personally, can&#8217;t wait to see where you go as we go forward. And it&#8217;s been a real privilege and an honor to be able to speak with you. I think all of our listeners and subscribers, I hope they&#8217;re going to follow the story and get in touch and stay part of it.

People compare Bitcoin with what they know and use daily: the transaction layer of the current monetary system. But transactional utilities such as card companies and payment processors do not work on their own. Instead, these systems rely on the underlying layers of central and commercial banks, bank accounts, and settlement networks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Money today is layered &#8211; and has been so for hundreds of years. Bitcoin is evolving in a similar manner. There seems to be a natural tendency for a strong monetary base layer, on which further, more agile instruments are built.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A note: this article is inspired by Nik Bhatia\u2019s<a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Layered-Money-Dollars-Bitcoin-Currencies-ebook\/dp\/B08PS293NT\"> <em>Layered Money: From Gold and Dollars to Bitcoin and Central Bank Digital Currencies<\/em><\/a> &#8211; a book on the logic of monetary evolution published in January 2021. All the quotes in the following text are from Bhatia\u2019s book.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Money is a pyramid<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cBefore layered money, there was simply money.\u201c<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A cursory glance at monetary systems today can evoke an impression that many parallel monetary standards exist. We have dollars, pounds, euros, and about 180 other national currencies. A monetary cacophony.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the truth is there are multiple <em>currencies<\/em>, but essentially one <em>money<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To understand the distinction between a currency and money, it\u2019s helpful to get acquainted with history.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For thousands of years, most humanity used precious metals like gold and silver as the dominant form of money. As civilization expanded and the extent of trade along with it, people quickly learned about the downside of precious metals: they are heavy and thus expensive to move around. A workaround needed to be found, so that trade could continue expanding. Thus the concept of a <em>deferred settlement <\/em>was born.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Deferred settlement is an idea that you don\u2019t have to pay for goods or services in the generally accepted money straight away. Instead, you pay with a money substitute such as an accounting entry (debt), the promissory note (banknote), or various forms of securities. All the money substitutes throughout history always had one thing in common: if we followed the line of promises, we would find there\u2019s always one final settlement in the end -the underlying money in the form of precious metal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider the well-known names of national currencies like dollar, pound, or mark. These terms originally denoted a standardized weight unit of gold or silver:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>dollar = 1.6 grams of gold or 24 grams of silver<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>mark = 233.856 grams of silver<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>pound sterling = 7.32 grams of gold<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though various currencies emerged in history, these were only local denominations of money proper. In the form of coins, these currencies were actual money, while in the form of notes, they were money substitutes. The most important difference between money and currency\/monetary substitutes is the trust factor. When a merchant accepts a silver coin for payment, the transaction is immediately settled, and the merchant doesn\u2019t have to trust his counterparty. On the other hand, when the merchant accepts a note, he has to trust that the note issuer will make good on his promise to redeem the note in silver. But such a trade-off made sense from an economic perspective. Moving around lumps of precious metal was less and less practical for an ever-expanding trade. So precious metal became the rarely used settlement layer, while notes and accounts became the transaction layer of everyday trade.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"image.png\" src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/ODGRGDIPkRo2lEO7np6yrsTw4vsH_FejXullZV6sycbnj_MBktF0-4WGJWqwL4vNNK5RjhcySpEI5-mSeiBAwUVFJHSnmRjtQ3lPZb0hwas53YiBcPuoCq2ItyieROU7_Oy-siUk\" width=\"602\" height=\"276\"> <em>Monetary pyramid before central banking.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>U.S. Treasuries: the current money<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;In gold&#8217;s absence, the Fed&#8217;s balance sheet used U.S. Treasuries as its dominant asset, and the private sector used them as the omnipotent form of monetary collateral. &#8220;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what is money in today&#8217;s world, and does the world share one monetary standard as was the historical norm? Today&#8217;s money isn&#8217;t reliant on gold or silver anymore. Indeed it does, and the money today is the U.S. Treasuries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After most national currencies lost their linkage to gold between world War I and II, only the U.S. dollar remained backed by gold. That&#8217;s why the U.S. dollar became the world reserve currency after the Bretton-Woods agreement in 1944. Then in 1971, president Nixon unilaterally decided that the U.S. dollar would not be redeemable for gold anymore. Nevertheless, the U.S. dollar retained its position as a global reserve currency. But the money proper today isn&#8217;t the dollar per se. Instead, the dollar as such is backed by the &#8220;full faith and credit of the U.S. government&#8221; &#8211; essentially by U.S. government bonds (Treasuries). As Nik Bhatia points out, treasuries are today&#8217;s risk-free collateral and the sought-after ultimate monetary settlement worldwide. Treasuries are the closest thing comparable to gold&#8217;s historical role of the final settlement, of course with one major difference: there is an unlimited amount of debt that can be created by the government and bought by the central bank, with all the consequences in the form of inflation, business cycle, and speculative bubbles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One confusing thing about the modern financial system is the detachment of the settlement layer from the money itself. While it&#8217;s true that we can settle a transaction by simply handing over dollar bills, most of the money today isn&#8217;t in the form of cash but instead exists in an electronic form. Moreover, there are multiple settlement networks around the world today: SWIFT, Fedwire, ACH, and others. So the current monetary pyramid (in a very simplified form) looks like this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"image.png\" src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/LJsOdzmgAZwo5Ryx6wFrcdtX2LTj1k7Vt9Stc4qxe1gmTzZjYLawYZp_1Bk0yw6FKAAuzXPEzbi6YOTo3_kdzY2zdKk4aiEv6i3jWF_aprn_6jQyvbuu7_rXo5DgPG-PmE0hsOq8\" width=\"602\" height=\"311\"> <em>Modern monetary pyramid.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bitcoin: cryptographic proofs instead of trust<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><\/p><p><em>\u201cThe most fascinating component of Satoshi\u2019s design of Bitcoin was his intention for it to mimic gold as first-layer, counterparty-free money.\u201c<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As Bhatia argues in his book, Bitcoin is best understood as money, following the same hierarchical development we\u2019ve witnessed in history. Through this optic, we find that bitcoin the asset is the money proper, living on the base layer of the blockchain. A confirmed on-chain transaction is a final settlement within Bitcoin\u2019s monetary universe &#8211; there is no further backing or credit relation when a user holds bitcoin in his address. The most important effect is that there is no trust requirement when working with the base layer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin\u2019s base layer is admittedly minimalistic. It doesn\u2019t allow for much other than broadcasting and settling of transactions in between user addresses. In this regard, it is pretty similar to gold or SWIFT &#8211; all that we seek from these settlement layers is maximum reliability. Of course, other capabilities can be built on top of the robust base layer, as has been the case throughout history.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The major difference between Bitcoin and the preceding monetary standards is that there is no trust prerequisite as we go deeper down the monetary layers. Instead, Bitcoin\u2019s second layer in the form of the Lightning Network relies on<a href=\"https:\/\/en.bitcoin.it\/wiki\/Hash_Time_Locked_Contracts\"> Hash Timelocked Contracts<\/a> (HTLC) &#8211; simple, smart contracts where the users creating payment channels lock their bitcoin. Thus, users can \u201cfall back\u201d to the base layer bitcoin at any time without losing their money if the counterparty misbehaves. This is a significant improvement to the monetary pyramid, as history is full of breaches of trust on various layers &#8211; from the widespread practice of fractional reserves to unfair economic reforms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"image.png\" src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/zWBzBCCWdgJgj1odvfitaH6M4DQ77_UyAJV5Gt1Z4PjHWoKdc9RzvSx7BXdkrFycNRxnNKuWDDMHMtahwbqtmgPtaKud1APToXG7liqAkSbD3TbfsV_TBeDiJfWORTN6h6rToVSm\" width=\"602\" height=\"299\"> <em>Bitcoin monetary pyramid.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The capacity of Lightning Network channels has been<a href=\"https:\/\/bitcoinvisuals.com\/ln-capacity\"> rising exponentially<\/a> this year, with over 2000 bitcoin currently dedicated to the transaction layer providing a capacity of more than $80 million for its users to perform instant, near-costless transactions all around the world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there\u2019s more to Bitcoin layers. A third layer is built on top of the Lightning Network graph &#8211; a value and data transfer layer. This is still a very recent development (Lightning Network itself has been live only since 2018), but it is one to watch in the future. So far, the most promising projects are<a href=\"https:\/\/www.rgbfaq.com\/faq\/what-is-rgb\"> RGB<\/a>, an asset issuance network;<a href=\"https:\/\/lnmarkets.com\/\"> LN Markets<\/a>, a bitcoin derivatives platform;<a href=\"https:\/\/sphinx.chat\/\"> Sphinx Chat<\/a>, a privacy-preserving messenger; and<a href=\"https:\/\/www.impervious.ai\/\"> Impervious API<\/a>, a programmatic layer for secure P2P data transmissions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, we are able to address the criticism from the beginning of this article adequately. Bitcoin isn\u2019t comparable to Visa or PayPal simply because it doesn\u2019t make sense to compare across the monetary layers. Onchain bitcoin is the base layer where we find money proper in the form of bitcoin, the asset. It is where the final settlement in the form of an on-chain transaction occurs. If we were to compare Bitcoin with the current financial system in terms of settlement speed, the appropriate comparison would be with the likes of SWIFT &#8211; where the final settlement for cross-border transactions takes days. Visa or PayPal, on the other hand, is comparable with the Lightning Network.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Viewing Bitcoin through the lens of layered money allows us to understand why Bitcoin is evolving the way it is. The layered approach reflects the historical evolution of money, where each layer provides for a more complex use case over the preceding one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The base layer in the form of blockchain is robust and simple, having just enough capability to achieve decentralized and distributed consensus, execute the algorithmic monetary policy, perform large settlements, and enter simple, smart contracts to open up a transaction layer. Development on the base layer follows a conservative path, as the base layer provides the foundation for further layers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The transaction layer in the form of the Lightning Network has slightly expanded capabilities over the base layer. However, its primary function is to scale up the Bitcoin transaction capacity to the level of modern payment networks such as Visa or PayPal. Further layers built on top of the Lightning Network graph allow for yet more complex use cases &#8211; always with the cryptographic assurances to fall back to the previous layer if something goes wrong. Thus, each subsequent layer makes the preceding one stronger and more valuable without compromising on security.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, there are also attempts to construct trust-based layers on top of Bitcoin via federated sidechains and wrapped bitcoin on other blockchain platforms. When building bitcoin-focused services, it\u2019s crucial to realize the trade-offs of various layers, whether they are appropriate for our intents, and how we communicate them with potential users.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s also important to remember that these are still the early days, and bitcoin\u2019s short-term price can be manipulated. This is mainly caused by relatively low market capitalization (compared with other markets such as gold or securities) and a global market that is active 24\/7. So while bitcoin\u2019s volatility decreases over the years, it\u2019s best not to speculate on short-term price moves and zoom out.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We will address these concerns in more detail in future articles.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Money is layered &#8211; and has been so for hundreds of years.

Now we\u2019ve met at a crossroads of exponential growth even during unprecedented times and continue to celebrate our resilience together. The festival perfectly encompasses our desire to support inclusive spaces that are conscious, welcoming, and enriching to everyone who joins them.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People from Vacuumlabs have been attending the festival for years, but there\u2019s more to our parallel history than just the numbers. Atmosfera festival is known for a lot of recurring guests that build their own friendly community, and that kind of long lasting and deep friendship is what we want to give everyone who joins us.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We value attention to detail and quality, which is why we love the offering of homemade, locally sourced goods and the spotlight on indie artists Atmosfera brings. The program even extends into the educational topics our community loves to explore. We\u2019re a curious group, so it\u2019s exciting to see that this year the festival covered topics like biohacking, society, philosophy, and cryptocurrency. We even participated in informative programming &#8211; our cryptocurrency expert David Stancel joined in on a discussion and QA all about the world of crypto.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the variety of programming and friendly community, you can take anyone in your family &#8211; from your 2 year old to your 81 year old grandma to your most discerning teenage cousin. We love to support and join up with welcoming spaces no matter what form they take. And we can count on Atmosfera being a great place for everyone and would happily continue taking part with our Vacuumlabs team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"681\" src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Atmosfera2021_07082021_martina_mlcuchova-36-2-1024x681.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12501\" srcset=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Atmosfera2021_07082021_martina_mlcuchova-36-2-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Atmosfera2021_07082021_martina_mlcuchova-36-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Atmosfera2021_07082021_martina_mlcuchova-36-2-768x511.jpg 768w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Atmosfera2021_07082021_martina_mlcuchova-36-2-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Atmosfera2021_07082021_martina_mlcuchova-36-2.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Photo <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mmmusicphoto.com\/\">Martina Mlcuchova<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Our very own Martin \u010cudrn\u00e1k shared his experiences attending the festival with his family and friends &#8211; who also happen to be his colleagues. Martin set out with 3 others from both Vacuumlabs and Rychlotest to carpool to the festival so he gave us a very colorful account of his experiences.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t attended the festival before, but I love to discover new things. The first thing that caught my attention about Festival Atmosfera was how unique the experience and location was.The whole festival was really a great mix of modern and folk, giving it a very unique atmosphere that felt completely organic in that location\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Martin goes on to describe the scenic atmosphere of the festival that starts long before you enter the festival grounds. The road eventually winds off the highway, and our group followed a winding path through the woods until they reached the festival grounds in a secluded forest clearing. Close to home, but still sequestered far from ordinary city life, and entirely organically placed in the surroundings. The final result is something in between a folk meeting with a timeless atmosphere and modern festival with above standard modern services and safety.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI did end up discovering a new band too. Malalata &#8211; a kind of balkan folk-modern genre that you can really get exercise dancing to.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"681\" src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Atmosfera2021_07082021_martina_mlcuchova-130-2-1024x681.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12502\" srcset=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Atmosfera2021_07082021_martina_mlcuchova-130-2-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Atmosfera2021_07082021_martina_mlcuchova-130-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Atmosfera2021_07082021_martina_mlcuchova-130-2-768x511.jpg 768w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Atmosfera2021_07082021_martina_mlcuchova-130-2-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Atmosfera2021_07082021_martina_mlcuchova-130-2.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Photo <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mmmusicphoto.com\/\">Martina Mlcuchova<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another member of our Vacuumlabs team, Eva Fackova, joined the festival as an organizer. We want people to feel comfortable pursuing their passions and projects here, so we\u2019re really glad this came together perfectly. Eva explains her involvement with a lot of heart:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI have a big connection to Atmosfera. I met Vacuumlabs thanks to the link that already existed between them and it\u2019s a collaboration I want to build on long term. Atmosfera is the reason I have this great work at Vacuumlabs, and Vacuumlabs is the reason I have the freedom to continue working with Atmosfera.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Eva, the whole experience was deeply emotional because it was the first live event she, or most people there, could take part in after a year of lockdowns and doubt.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThere was a huge feeling of freedom and joy for me and it radiated off everyone there. It was equally cool seeing people there wearing Vacuumlabs shirts and seeing the friendly faces of my new colleagues at this festival.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a program and community as varied and unique as Vacuumlabs, this collaboration was a natural choice and we&#8217;re excited to see where it goes next. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The fun of working with us comes in many forms and one of them is the cultural events we support and take part in.

Soon enough, nearly every aspect of traditional banking will become integrated as a seamless and invisible feature into every industry\u2019s product or service experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example: say that you are running an accounting SaaS. Why not offer the ability for customers to also generate invoices, get them paid, and hold those funds until salaries are due? Where the original revenue model was monthly subscription fees to the accounting software, now you can also make money by offering financial services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another example: imagine you sell high-ticket items \u2014&nbsp;like cars, solar panels, or electric bikes \u2014 to consumers? Would it then not be convenient for those buyers to immediately buy insurance <em>right along with their purchase?<\/em> And while we\u2019re on it, maybe some buyers want to take out a loan to finance their purchase?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Embedded finance allows virtually any company to find ways to offer financial services alongside their main experience at a fraction of the complexity and costs that would have been possible even five years ago. In much the same way that Stripe some 10 years ago enabled developers to take credit card payments on their website with just a few lines of code, so a consortium of embedded finance providers are enabling any company to offer checking accounts, saving accounts, insurance, credit and more at a fraction of the traditional complexity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Embedded finance is already here. It is just a matter of where you look<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though this third FinTech wave is still in its infancy, successes are already available in a multitude of markets and industries. Let\u2019s explore a handful of examples, to make it clear where this is headed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>BigTech are all in finance now<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether it\u2019s an Apple credit card or an offering from Google, Facebook or Amazon, all the big tech companies have now supplemented their software and hardware offerings with extensive financial arms. In the case of Google and Apple these services had an obvious point of integration with their respective app stores, and in all cases they have an enormous user base to immediately tap into. Financial services also provide subtle lock-ins to bring users deeper into the respective company\u2019s ecosystem.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Chinese tech giants like Tencent and Alibaba are playing a somewhat similar strategy \u2014 which we will discuss separately, below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tesla to become \u201ca major insurance company\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elon Musk announced last year that Tesla wants to become a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/elon-musk-tesla-launching-insurance-company-nationwide-hiring-2020-7?IR=T\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">major player in the insurance market<\/a>. The electric car maker already sells car insurance along with their Tesla cars in the state of California, and plans to roll out insurance offerings across the United States.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tesla cases clearly illustrates how embedded finance can allow companies to offer better financial services than banks potentially could: the company plans to leverage the data from its cars&#8217; computers to calculate the appropriate risk profile&nbsp; \u2014&nbsp;and therefore insurance rate \u2014&nbsp;of each driver. Access to the appropriate data enables Tesla to offer a seamless, smooth and competitive insurance experience. According to the Tesla CEO, access to more accurate data should translate into roughly 20% cheaper insurance.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Visa invests in Gojek, the Indonesian-born superapp<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though the name Gojek might not ring a bell for most westerners, Gojek is a behemoth in Southeast Asia. It offers all your on-demand needs, packaged into one single \u201csuper app\u201d: ordering food, transportation, digital payments, hyper-local delivery, and a dozen other services. To give a sense of scale: Gojek completes more daily food orders than Grubhub, Uber Eats, and DoorDash combined, <em>and<\/em> also executes more trips than Lyft per day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Within many of its native markets, where banking penetration is low and most transactions are still cash-based, Gojek offers a way for millions of people to leapfrog the entire banking industry and simply have an account with Gojek. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fintechfutures.com\/2019\/07\/visa-invests-in-southeast-asias-payments-platform-gojek\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Visa invested in a 2019 Series F<\/a> fundraising to help bring that vision to reality, and the Gojek financial services arm \u201cGoPay\u201d is amongst the fastest growing within its portfolio of services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other rideshare companies ranging from Lyft to Grab and others are in a very similar position, all offering increasingly sophisticated financial services to its user base alongside ride sharing alone. Uber jump early on the embedded finance offerings as well, but <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/ronshevlin\/2020\/08\/03\/ubers-departure-from-financial-services-a-speed-bump-on-the-path-to-embedded-finance\/?sh=78697a777673\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">has since pulled back<\/a> from financial services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>WeChat and Alibaba are bringing bottom-up financial inclusion to the Chinese market<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chinese superapp WeChat \u2014 owned by Tencent Holdings, and the largest standalone mobile app in the world \u2014&nbsp;started its life as a messaging platform much like Whatsapp or Facebook Messenger, but now also offers a complex set of financial services. Due to its wide distribution and deep coverage within the Chinese market, it was only natural for people to want to transact financial transactions via their WeChat app, too. WeChat Pay is now the dominant mobile payment network in the Chinese market.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>AliPay originates from the Alibaba family of products, and offers similarly mobile payment services that both challenges and supplements the WeChat Pay network in providing extensive mobile payments coverage in China.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>MindBody makes 50-60% of it\u2019s revenue in financial services<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>MindBody is the definitive leader in class scheduling software for fitness studios, yoga studios, dance studios, and similar. While its logical base revenue model as a SaaS company is a monthly or annual subscription offering, the company now makes <a href=\"https:\/\/tearsheet.co\/payments\/whats-behind-software-companies-becoming-payment-companies\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">over 50% of its revenue<\/a> by enabling transactions natively on its platform. The money is no longer primarily in the software offering, but rather in being able to capture value on every yoga course and boxing class scheduled.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Stripe valued at $95 billion<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In April Stripe became the most valued private venture-backed company in the US, when it\u2019s Series H fundraising put the company valuation <a href=\"https:\/\/news.crunchbase.com\/news\/under-the-hood-a-closer-look-at-stripe-the-most-highly-valued-venture-backed-private-company-in-the-us\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">at $95 billion dollars<\/a>. While the company started off in 2010 as a service that offered easy credit card payments for developers, it has since expanded its product range to cover a wide portfolio of embedded finance offerings. It makes it trivially easy for practically any company to offer everything from point-of-sale payments to fraud management, credit risk assessments and much, much more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stripe processes hundreds of billions of dollars per year in transactions, of which it charges 2.9 percent of total transaction value and 30 cents for each payment transaction. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/how-payment-processor-stripe-became-silicon-valleys-hottest-startup-11618306201\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">According to the Wall Street Journal<\/a> the company reported $7.4 billion in revenue last year. That payment processing network is now expanding to offer deeply integrated financial services into any product or service imaginable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Where banking and financial services used to be standalone functions, they will now come invisibly embedded into all other business functions<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The further unbundling and rebundling of financial services is driven by deep fundamentals: financial services and transactions never truly stand alone \u2014&nbsp;they are always embedded into other functions in our lives. Whether it\u2019s messaging, social, ride sharing, CRM or accounting, in all cases the financial function is simply a component of the actual job being done. In a continuous push to make traditional banking services more and more of a background utility, developers can now simply plug the SDK of any specific unbundled banking activity they might need directly into their application workflow, and make financial services run seamlessly run in the background.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As embedded finance options become more widespread and more easily available to all developers, this trend is unlikely to stall or reverse. As of 2021, the embedded finance trend is only getting started. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/matthewharris\/2019\/11\/19\/fintech-the-fourth-platform-part-one\/?sh=fe1a934cb28c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Others have argued<\/a> that fintech will simply be the next technology stack of the internet: first connectivity, then cloud, then the ubiquity of mobile, and now embedded fintech to allow financial transactions as part of the basic infrastructure of our connected digital world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a happy side-effect, this new paradigm will also give hundreds of millions of extra users access to financial services that they simply didn\u2019t have before. Platforms like AliPay, WeChat Pay, Grab and Gojek have each <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pulse\/future-finance-embedded-theodora-lau\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">unlocked access to basic financial services<\/a> for millions of users. Embedded finance is an exciting development in our western world, but potentially even more disruptive and live-changing in developing economies.&nbsp;<br>&#8212;<br>At Vacuumlabs, we are excited to play at the forefront of these developments with a multitude of our clients and partners.

They said, \u2018if you&#8217;re going to deal with our bank, you&#8217;re going to go to our brunch. You&#8217;re going to ring our telephone number. You&#8217;re going to use our digital channel and you&#8217;re gonna use our paperwork.\u2019 \u201c<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Those words are from Simon Lyons. He\u2019s the Head of Ecosystem Engagement at the Open Banking Implementation Entity (OBIE), and he recently sat down with us to talk about the revolution occurring right now in banking.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Banking information has traditionally stayed off-limits. Small businesses and digital services have been unable to integrate with accounts in order to provide their customers with improved experiences. But organisations like OBIE are creating new expectations for banks to share data and connect with these services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over in the UK, OBIE is producing guidelines and setting software standards in the industry. It\u2019s a road to standardised connections between banks and service providers, which will create faster transactions, easier data-access, and more freedom for both consumers and SMEs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Small businesses have always dealt with complicated processes around banking, and that\u2019s about to change with open banking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But is there anyone to blame for the previously lockedbanking system that made life so difficult for SMEs?SMEs? Simon doesn\u2019t think so.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cost of implementing changes at large banks has been prohibitively expensive. So while OBIE\u2019s guidelines will encourage them, it will also create opportunities for small, agile fintechs to fill the gaps for SMEs and consumers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cOpen banking is for people who may well get a good banking service. So they can interface with that bank in the way they want.

I&#8217;m your host Helene Panzarino and today I&#8217;m joined by Simon Lyons,&nbsp; the head of Ecosystem at Open Banking, and we&#8217;re going to delve into all things open banking. If you&#8217;re with us for the first time welcome. If you are a regular subscriber, lovely to have you back, and please share with your friends, share with your colleagues. We&#8217;d love to have your audiance. Simon welcome to Banking on air. It&#8217;s lovely to have you with us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Simon Lyons: <\/strong>[00:00:30] It&#8217;s lovely to be here, Helene. Thank you very much for the invite. Look forward to talking. It should be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:00:34] Simon. Thank you. I think it will be because actually I really wanted to talk to you again because we met on an another format and other online virtual format and I was super impressed and very much thinking, gosh, this guy really is getting to the nub of the problem and not dancing around things. So for me and for our subscribers, I really want to get to what&#8217;s going on. I still think there&#8217;s some confusion around what open banking is, what it was meant to be? Where is it going to go? Lots of things. I think there was a misconception in the UK that it was going to be all bells, whistles, fireworks, and overnight everything was going to change. So it&#8217;d be good just to unpack that and to see with you what you take take on it, get your thoughts on it, get your view on it. And see where we might be going with it as well. Before we get into that, let&#8217;s find a little bit more about you. So the role that you have now, and maybe how you got there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Simon Lyons: <\/strong>[00:01:25] Well, thank you. I&#8217;m a very, very lucky man. I managed to get a job called Head of Ecosystem Engagement and gave me two really distinct roles in open banking. The first one was to grow the ecosystem commercially. So banks that join open banking can be TPPs to bring them in just to make sure that that FCA accreditation and membership of open banking was joined together. So we had a club basically, where trusted members could join us and could get the benefits open banking, and so that we could help them in some way and help them be a point of reference and the appoint of accreditation. It&#8217;s very, very important to understand that all these businesses in open banking are FCA accredited. They are all nationally competent. They can all say, well, we&#8217;ve gone through a certain. The second half of the role was the fun, but I get to engage with industry. So I get to talk to different parts of industry to try to extol the benefits of open banking. If you understand my past, you might understand why my dialogue maybe is slightly different than others. I spent a great deal of my career in a bank called the&nbsp; ????Bank. And in there, what I used to run was all the digital engagement with corporates, but it wasn&#8217;t a technical job. It was all about getting data to them, getting payments to them, being efficient, stopping paper, and getting people to work with the bank and as efficient way as we possibly could. That lens spread across two SMEs working in vulnerable adult banking. I&#8217;m looking to have launched with some of my colleagues, the first appointee ship and deputy ship account with local authorities in the late nineties. I&#8217;m that old, I&#8217;ve got extensive experience across agency clearing and across local authority banking. All those come from one thing, which is a real understanding of high volume banking. That really is where I saw a great deal of benefits. There&#8217;s one statement I think is really important. No one person knows all the benefits of open banking. No one. Because we&#8217;ve got 5.9 million SMEs in this country. We&#8217;ve got they account for 50% of the employment. They all do different things and they all have different banking relationships. They all use different products. So for any one person to say, I know the answer to everything, arogants the right word. It&#8217;s far too much of a sweeping statement. It doesn&#8217;t provide enough credibility. My view was that there is enormous benefits for open banking within corporates that have high volume populations within government, within people that suffer from some of the legacy problems of bankings over the years. There&#8217;s not a great deal of innovation in banking. I think the last big one was the ATM in 1968. But I want to position what open banking is in probably a dialogue the others wouldn&#8217;t use. For many, many years banks have told us how todeal with them.. They have said, if you&#8217;re going to deal with a bank, you&#8217;re going to go to my brunch. You&#8217;re going to ring my telephone number. You&#8217;re going to use my digital channel and you&#8217;re gonna use my paperwork. Well, that&#8217;s alts with most of their industries in our .com years. Where we could access last minute.com. We could aggregate data from third providers. We could do things. What open banking did and it&#8217;s driven by standards. And this is something I think that it is open banking&nbsp; greatest strength is that we said, well, now you can engage with your bank how you want, you don&#8217;t have to use the bank channel. You don&#8217;t have to use the telephone line. Is somethings, you still have to do via that way. You don&#8217;t have to access it that way. So what it meant was that for big corporates, for TPPs that deliver solutions for fintechs that wants to build something out differently, you can get the bank you want, not the one you were given. Banking has been aggregated and that&#8217;s an enormous statement and probably one you don&#8217;t hear very often.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino<\/strong>: [00:04:39] It&#8217;s very interesting. And there&#8217;s a lot in that as well, because of course, I was going to ask you what is open banking and for the general public&#8217;s understanding if they&#8217;re not actually involved in it, either as a bank or as an SME, but you flagged the word standards as well. And when this first launched there was some question around the first nine banks and we&#8217;ll roll back to the CMA nine. The standards around the APIs, the tech standards not being uniform. Was that done intentionally? Was that just the way for the banks to not engage? Clearly the banks are sitting on data, which is a the crown jewels for them and they didn&#8217;t want to get involved. So I want to go back to standards versus laws or regulations as well, because I still think people don&#8217;t really grasp what it is. If we roll back to 2016, when the CMA decided that they wanted to look into the competition and markets, authorities wanted to look into competition in the landscape in the UK. I think around that time, by the time it got to around 2010, we&#8217;ve lost so many banks in the UK, literally probably a hundred banks or over a hundred by consolidation or closure that over 70% of the business accounts were sitting with probably six banks, which is of course was not a competitive situation. And we tried other things like bank referral scheme for lending and other things that just didn&#8217;t really hit the mark. And then that dreary afternoon in January, 2018, when open banking came onto the scene after PSD two obviously was I think seen by some, and I say this there&#8217;s some people that are always going to be slightly derogatory and they&#8217;re poking holes. They&#8217;re looking for holes. And they&#8217;re looking to say, yeah, what was that?&nbsp; What is it, what did it achieve? I think people don&#8217;t who are doing this, don&#8217;t understand what it was. So if we take it back to, and we&#8217;ll come back to standards,&nbsp; what that was, what was open banking meant to be when it launched?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Simon Lyons: <\/strong>[00:06:20] So open banking was part of the something I&#8217;m not an expert on this, but give me the CMA remedies that were launched there was a range of them. There was ones about digital account opening. There was,&nbsp; one&#8217;s about being able to move your business account. There was the accompaniment of the pay UK product, which is cast Credit card switch service, which all set out to go and make a difference. I mean, increased competition is an easy way to go and take that and, you know, for people that want to read the order word for word verbatim, that they can go and do that. I think that what was need what you&#8217;ve got to bear in mind was, was that this has never happened before. So there&#8217;s a headline there that says increased competition. And what you&#8217;ve got to do is put a stake in the ground somewhere and start it. If I&#8217;m very, very complimentary for a moment, the value of standards is something that we should look at, which has allowed us to have a level playing field. And I&#8217;ll expand why, if you go both open banking, which is above 7 million turnover above the accounts in the same ,you get to corporate banking now in corporate banking, you&#8217;ve been able to use swift host to host, statement messaging, MC 1 or 2 9, 4, 3, 9, 4 twos, all those good things that come out. BAI 2 all those good things that come out. So corporates had these solutions. In simplicity what we did in this&nbsp; is we brought that down a layer, and we said that what we&#8217;re going to do is going to create it. But instead of it being a commercial standard where people want to use swift files, where swift charge for it, they go and do it. We should. No, no, no. This is the basis. This is the minimum point. And you have to set there as well and stuff to use the word minimum, which is incredibly important because if you set a point that everybody&#8217;s got to achieve and they can excel above that. Whereas when you leave a completely free market within banking&nbsp; and then standards, you end up with 15 different standards. We don&#8217;t need to look very far to see what happens when you leave people to build their own, where people try to build out schemes on their own. Look at ACH in the states, look at some of the Australian payment schemes where they&#8217;ve been very much commercially led as well. The real value there is, is that we gave a start point. Is it the end point? No. The reason I say that as well as is that open banking gets compared to cards on a daily basis. It frustrates the hell out of me. Cards have been around for about 50 years. It&#8217;s a commercial protection scheme. They actually have close to ubiquity for access. The parity of the banking platforms that provide cards at CSUs is the first data is the yellow chilies, the large Italian platform there as well. They provide the same output so people can interface. And just look at that for a moment. Have a look at travel. And if you look at travel, you have something called a GDS global distribution system. I think it&#8217;s called a data system. You have an ability to winning cars where people can aggregate the data on a booking with the payment, but it&#8217;s not within the payment and they can transfer all this data and use it. If you want to see what standards builds out, you&#8217;ve simply got to look at the larger corporates and where you get. So what did open banking set out to do? Could anybody have said what the 10 year goal was? No I don&#8217;t think they could.Could they say what it would change and what it would create? Yes, they could. I think they could say that it would create options for people. It would give people the option and life is nothing without options. So examples of where you&#8217;ve done that anybody listening who is self-employed has probably sent their bank statements, their accounts, and they&#8217;ve probably sent a shoe box with receipts in it, and they probably waited for their accountants. Do their bookkeeping more than that now, because what you can do now is as you can transfer via open work&#8217;s just been pushed by tink. And then we&#8217;ve got the tink purchase by visa. So now people can share their bank statements with their accounts and easylly. We&#8217;re not innovating that we&#8217;re making something very efficient. We&#8217;re making it very practical. It works on a very practical level. Did open banking sets out to make sure that account statements will be efficient for accountants? No. Lending. If we have a look at the traditional model of lending of credit underwriting, we want a PNL we want a balance sheet, or what are all those businesses under two years old? So suddenly what we provided for open banking was the ability to look at the bank account. We provided that. By the net effect of creating efficiency and giving instant data in this case, the bank account data, we enabled industries to react quicker, module morgages, open banking, led morgages, and we&#8217;ll go that just digger. He&#8217;s got no trading history. It looks at his bank account. We look at vulnerable adults. We&#8217;ve got that. So could I tell you what they set their scene for? No, I couldn&#8217;t. They wanted to create competition that actually created a great deal of efficiency, a massive efficiency. And from that efficiency will come choice. As people use open banking, it becomes more mainstream. It&#8217;s not yet .&nbsp; Today I spend a lot of my time talking to a C-suite and directors and senior people in corporates. And the first thing they say&nbsp; is what&#8217;s open banking. So what we&#8217;ve created? We&#8217;ve created a catalyst for change. We set out to create competition, but that is an outcome. It&#8217;s not one of the steps on the way. The outcome is to create people to change and people to move up. Along this journey on the way now we&#8217;ve definitely given the solid foundation blocks. It was 813 million API calls last month. I think that&#8217;s pretty good. And those API calls are all call imbalanced data from accounts. Advent of government taken onboard insurance companies, wealth tech. You&#8217;ve got Siemens embedding quests to play within the pre-pay meters. We&#8217;ve got to look at what enables the outcome. The outcome is competition. The outcome has changed, but it&#8217;s the efficiencies that drive that they&#8217;re the ones the catalyst to make it move.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:11:19] It&#8217;s very interesting because again, I come back, people would think that it was the competition, but actually when you speak about it, then it becomes more meaningful for me. And I&#8217;m already on board&nbsp; as someone who thinks that it has a value for SMEs. I hadn&#8217;t really thought about that government let&#8217;s say during the pandemic, when everyone was trying to access information and share information for the stimulus packages, whatever they might be, whether they&#8217;re individuals or for businesses we saw there was everyone focused on digital identity, but we saw that there was something missing in the chain, which has then gone from the large banks, the alternative finance providers, to be able to get that information exchange using open banking and perhaps one of the silver linings of something so horrific is that people learned that this was an option and they learned how to use it. I also want to ask you about that because with SMEs I I&#8217;ve been beating the drum on funding for SMEs for quite a long time and I maintain that most business owners are not aware of the full spectrum of finances. So I&#8217;m always trying to add. What was there, or is there a lack of education for the community? Did people learn by features and benefits and should we have done more to get more people using it more quickly?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Simon Lyons: <\/strong>[00:12:28] You say features and benefits in the same sentence I think that two don&#8217;t live in the same room. Features are one thing, but features don&#8217;t necessarily mean a benefit. For me benefits is absolutely everything. It is the crooks. Now put it really simply. If you&#8217;re an SME, that&#8217;s just applied for lending with your bank, with a broker and you&#8217;ve been knocked back on another broker says, let me try for you. That&nbsp; experience will say to you, well, why? Why did I get funding that? Now as someone with a long, long history and cashflow and the power of it as well, I&#8217;ve seen lending for VAT at 52%. Which I think is genius. But then again, I&#8217;ve also seen somebody with the same information, get lending at 11%. And the reason they did it was, it was because the information was easier to access. So,&nbsp; I come back to this word all the time, easier efficiency. It really provides so much more to the SME that if they can upload their bank statements quicker, the underwriter can make a decision quicker on much more tangible information. A lot of the traditional underwriting and I don&#8217;t blame them because it&#8217;s an extremely high risk business is built around. Yeah. But we&#8217;ve given a new option. And the only reason the option is there is accessibility. We can now get people, their bank information much easier. So do the SMEs have a greater suite of options now? Yes, they do that. They absolutely do. I do agree with you with the challenge of education and getting it to them, but I think that&#8217;s where I come for me what is the most important point? How would SMEs learn about this? Would they learn by. Reading the government pamphlet? No, probably not because. They&#8217;re in the club, they&#8217;re in the small community and they have a mate of theirs that recommends a broker. I get asked every day, I want to get this one to get that. I&#8217;ve just been asked this morning, do I know a morgage broker? Obviously they use open banking and it&#8217;s that referral process we&#8217;ve got to get to that internal referral process. How do you do that? You do that by people having a positive experience and the message spreading it&#8217;s precedent. And that precedent is set by dealing with bodies that you trust. So if you look at Jack who bought a Digger that I know, well, he told about 10 of his friends, that this broker is using open banking. If you&#8217;ve not traded for two years and you&#8217;re not met the rest of the 900 and you know, there&#8217;s bits missing in the chain, they&#8217;ll do it. It might cost you a little bit more in interest. What you can get the digger because you need the digger to go make your living. I think it&#8217;s always scares me. When I hear people talking about SMEs and I don&#8217;t include you in this and about funding, they&#8217;re running a business as well. This should be easy. And the trust point, the recommendation is that I believe that what we&#8217;ve got to do is, and it doesn&#8217;t happen quickly. It&#8217;s a very much a bell curve. Look at the PayPal growth early two thousands. Look at when he gave away the $20, what people did with it.&nbsp; It&nbsp; the ballooned. We&#8217;ve got to get people so that their friends and family are talking about it and then it grows organically. It goes in. What it won&#8217;t do is it&#8217;s gotta be real to them,Banking is quite parochial. If you look at the hotspots of banking around the UK retail banking, isn&#8217;t it. You use any brand you want, but when you&#8217;re in SME&nbsp; banking as well, sometimes you&#8217;ll go to quite specialist places that want to work with you.&nbsp; Set of being a good example for draw down of loans. You&#8217;ll have, long bar, if you&#8217;re going to go and get a car black cause finance, same thing. People use certain industry specific offerings, and I believe federalization is the enemy. I&#8217;m a specialist, I specialize or die. You have to get people in a certain sector to understand it. So, a long answer to summarize, which is people learn by precedent and by referral and the one thing that needs to be in that precedent for is trust. And they get trust by working with bodies that they currently work with, who use a more efficient method or a friend says use my body. So I think there is some exciting things coming for SMEs<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:15:47] And in the UK and I&#8217;m sure this exists in other parts of the world as well. I know this the SBA, for example, the small business administration in the US. So we have at least four, that I can think of SME, kind of associations or organizations that lobby for our rights and offer certain discounted products and services, et cetera. And they&#8217;ve been around for a long time. And by joining them, I think we&#8217;re assuming that we trust them. Are they a good conduit?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Simon Lyons: <\/strong>[00:16:08] I think they, one of them. I used to bank the FSB when I was at the co-op. We used to go to Blackpool and see them up there and I think it was Vulcan house by the bottom of the runway at Blackwell airport. And they&#8217;ve got a certain voice book. The problem with people is, is that they all do different things. So I&#8217;m sure all of us have got family, friends that are self-employed. So I&#8217;ve got a brother-in-law that self-employed, he employs 68 people. He has absolutely no interest in any trade body whatsoever. But&nbsp; the fundamental there is his audiences is his bank. And he&#8217;s incredibly frustrated with him at the moment. So he&#8217;s gone to talk to certain other banks where I&#8217;ve been saying to him, Banking&#8217;s pretty generic. The price changes a little bit from bank to bank, but the way you access it is crucial. So we&#8217;ve just done some bulk API work with him, for his guys wages on a Friday, he said it saved him 11 hours a week of processing individual payments of copying from a spreadsheet. They&#8217;re very, very light touch. Is there one audience that speaks to everybody? I think the only one is the HMRC. Whether people trust the HMRC or not, their communication channels are unbelievable, but it&#8217;s whether or not that message is,&nbsp; the HMRC to give. I think there&#8217;s a really key point here as well. It&#8217;s not the bank&#8217;s fault. The banks have had to produce a service for SMEs, which is 50% of the client base to match all needs. So consequently, you get more generic channels and NSP.. I don&#8217;t blame them because the cost of change in a bank is astronomical. Open banking for banks, really, for me is people may well get a good banking service. If they can interface with that bank in the way they want. That&#8217;s really, really key. If the cash flow was visible to the bank and the bank could see it, and precession lending was available, which is something I would love to fix or get somewhere in there, then the fintechs can really play a role in this and really make some space. But I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s one audience and I&#8217;m a firm believer that every human is different and we can put them into populations, but we have to speak to those individual populations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:17:54] And in that sense with making the relationship with the bank more of what I want it to be and having intelligent data that comes out of my transactions. Presumably if I&#8217;m using a FinTech to make peace with your payments or something along the lines where I&#8217;m getting time back in my life and I&#8217;m getting paid faster than someone else is getting paid faster. Using open banking, the bank that&#8217;s involved in that it takes a smaller margin, but sees me as a potentially stronger customer where they can offer me other products and services and the relationship between myself and the relationship manager, if I have one, or if I haven&#8217;t been bolted into a group somewhere should be better. The thing that keeps running in the back of my mind, and maybe this is something that I have to get over as someone who&#8217;s owned a few SMEs over time is, Am I, as the SME owner prepared to share all my information in an aggregated format and be totally upfront and honest about it. Whereas before there might be a little bit of backing and dive in, and as we said, sometimes you get declined, you don&#8217;t always ask the question. You&#8217;ve just go away and say, I&#8217;m going to go use a credit card or get money from friends and family. I don&#8217;t really delve because up to this point, everything was pretty good. Now you might go to an alternative provider. Is there also there&#8217;s the bank and then there&#8217;s me as the business owner, a need for me to change something in the way that I approach this? And is that something that is potentially generational and falls away with a younger entrepreneur? Or is it something that doesn&#8217;t matter?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Simon Lyons: <\/strong>[00:19:20] Well If we go back, I used to run a CPP that did a cashflow product, which I still think is the best one I&#8217;ve ever seen, but for certain reasons, it doesn&#8217;t get out of that. The failure of businesses is the same right now as it wasin 1910.If you can make it to two years, you&#8217;ve got a long way in here as well. They all fell for the same reason, cashflow. And if you look at a bank, a bank only provides historical data. They have to, they have to vote a complete record. The gap between the business and the bank is the business wants to run a business and believes in themselves. They have that risk profile to do it. The bank has to adhere to risk policies and has to go and do it. So how do you fix it? Well, anything that would give you a better view of the future would be good. I mean, I find categorization a very, very hot topic of discussion because I&#8217;m very interested in, it&#8217;s great to know that I&#8217;ve been to Marks and Spencer&#8217;s, and I went to Nando&#8217;s last Thursday and, but you know what, I&#8217;d much, rather than a one I can go.It will be a very, very powerful piece of information. And every single banker, if somebody asks for lending, they will want a cashflow. Every single time. So as you say, you&#8217;ve got the relationship between the stuff lending is reactive as a rule. Once again, it is not sweeping step for every population. If we could do something with the banks where the businesses can be monitored during their cycles and the bank can be better aware and better future-proofed, then the businesses will naturally benefit because the bank have got lower risk lender. Obviously the further out the lending is in front of you, the lower the risk. Because, you know what the event is going to be. If you want it tomorrow, you pay the price for it, supply and demand. Natural economics that it really works that way. Does it need to change behaviors? Do you know what I don&#8217;t think it does. I think all it does it makes a rich relationship between client and bank. Once again, we get back to, as you say, generic relationship management in banks. When you go above that 7 million turnover, I was talking to two of the CMA known last week to the public sector team charity team, central government team, proxy management seem high volume payments, renewables . And they&#8217;re all specialists because the customers are work a lot. Whereas in SMEs, it&#8217;s the bundle that&#8217;s working on money. So what we can actually do here is we can change the relationship between the SME and the bank simply by giving the bank a better view of their life. With regards to them, the risk process. If it&#8217;s in the bank, you&#8217;re going to pay tax on it. You know. What wasn&#8217;t it is outside of that? It&#8217;s not my concern. It doesn&#8217;t bother me at any point in the day as well. But if the business can see there&#8217;s a benefit for them being more transparent, maybe in lifestyle businesses and in businesses without good pro finance professionals, because you got to pay for them, then they can get that information easier. I don&#8217;t think that and forgive me I may well offend some of our banking partners.I would never mean to do that. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s that realization of just how powerful this information is, because if a bank could look at presanctional lending for a customer and offer it via fintech , You&#8217;ve got a big event coming up a week on Thursday. Do you want to fund this? Do you want to use your overdraft? Do you want to pay on a card? Do you want to use invoice discounts in ? What would basically looking at is supply chain finance for SMEs at the right time? And that&#8217;s normally a very, very, very expensive process. So again, all we do is we&#8217;re bringing that enterprise technology down to the SME level as well. I would love to see the day where a banking app says to a customer, not based on the credit score, not based on the historical information, but says, Hey, we notice you&#8217;ve got a capital purchase coming up and we would really like to help you fund it. It will be wonderful. And I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re far away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:22:42] That&#8217;s for me is the joy in all of this as well, because I am a real huge proponent of cashflow forecasting. I can remember revolving credit lines when I was a banker myself and essentially .. A credit card becomes a revolving credit line. But in this instance, I also had a beauty business. Well, my journey and we were manufacturing a Shanghai, getting it over here, having to get it up to Liverpool two weeks before having a lot of stock tie it up, could never get a real time. valuation, never get pre-approved lines. Couldn&#8217;t factor the invoices because it was salary returned. Yet we were doing significant tens of thousands amount of product every hour of that journey. And that&#8217;s a huge business. I wasn&#8217;t alone in that. But there wasn&#8217;t that predictive ability. And again, like you say with banks, I love accountants, love you all, but you&#8217;re doing forensic. You&#8217;re not doing a forecast. By the time it&#8217;s happened it&#8217;s too late. So the predictive ability, the predictive analytics, the predictive forecasting, and I know we&#8217;ve had a crazy one and a half year, two years, behavior from before is difficult. But that&#8217;s the thing that you need to see. You need to see the forward. Not the necessarily what happened before. Although it&#8217;s valuable to a certain extent. So it&#8217;s, I mean,&nbsp; we got this all started over here following one for PSD2 in Europe. And now I can see, as I look around the world, the US is having a conversation about moving open banking on from being just commercially or market-driven. I&#8217;m seeing it when I&#8217;m in the Middle-East, in LATAM, as we did with other things within the FCA, are we helping people to understand our journey and learn knowledge share? Are we involved in any of the things that are happening like maybe by a certain type of bridge that works with open banking as we have with other types of FinTech? Are we involved in that or are we just setting our stole out and watching other people watching.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Simon Lyons: <\/strong>[00:24:27] I&#8217;m going to buy that one back if you don&#8217;t mind The&nbsp; problem is, is the consultation under the order? The answer is yes, but it&#8217;s not in the order and adult want to talk about things, not in the order of your mind. Okay. Let me give an answer. It&#8217;s a very, very interesting point as well.&nbsp; Open banking is instructed under the order from the CMA. We operate within the constraints of that order and with the benefits of that order this with it. However, you know, there is an awful lot of interest in what we do. Is there a watching brief that people take on what we are? Is the first ?Of course there is?Is a different models emerging? I mean, I think you just refer to LATAM, the Brazilian model is quite fascinating.&nbsp; The centralized hub of technology really is. Is&nbsp; quite remarkable. I always think that we would go back to that standards point as well. And we set the first standards. The good people, Freddy Gower, wonderful man incredible. One of the most important people in open banking in my opinion. But what we&#8217;ve done is we&#8217;ve created a thought point and a great point of reflection and investigation. And I think what people are doing when they look at open banking in the UK and look at what we did, once again, they&#8217;re applying it to their own territories. In the Gulf states it&#8217;s very, very different. You&nbsp; know that as well as I do. There are much bigger power brokers there than we have here in the UK. And I think what we&#8217;ve done is we&#8217;ve started the conversation about standards are incredible powerful, but how does it work for us? Canada, great example, that I know some of our members have spoken there as well and stuff, so yeah. The world is definitely asking lots of questions. There&#8217;s lots of international emails, I think is the best way to say it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:25:53] You mentioned Canada, cause I can remember being there maybe 2019 and everyone&#8217;s attitude was helping banking open shmanking. It wasn&#8217;t really, no one was really stepping up and taking it seriously. And know of course, all that has changed. And for me, it&#8217;s this kind of an inevitability that it will spin out because it makes sense. And if we are genuinely looking to SMEs to help us turn the corner post COVID, we have to give them every chance, every fighting chance to use the tools that are available. And maybe for the first time, a little bit more respect than they&#8217;ve had over the period of time. Prior to this, because they weren&#8217;t deemed the margin wasn&#8217;t good enough. There wasn&#8217;t a secondary market and some of the lending. And so it wasn&#8217;t really that exciting to work with an SME. But as we&#8217;ve changed, as the gig economy has changed and all this things are changing, they become much more important in the relationships. You mentioned the figure was an 841,000 API calls in a month?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Simon Lyons: <\/strong>[00:26:45] 830 million.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:26:47] Oh sorry. 830 million API calls. And do we have the regular number of users of open banking in the millions now?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Simon Lyons: <\/strong>[00:26:57] Yeah,&nbsp; we&#8217;re well over the 3 million point, obviously Open bank in announces that the big stage posts in that number as well, but&nbsp; we&#8217;re well over 3 million. There&#8217;s a very interesting thing there as well, because you know, there was, I saw an article today where somebody said, oh, we should have 30, but actually, , it&#8217;s quality, not quantity as well. I mean, 3 million is an enormous part of the working population. And do they know the viewster or did they trust the person they shared their information with that? That&#8217;s a key point, but I think the other really key point is there as well as is that we want really high value users, not high value financially, but high value that are engaged in the process and doing it. And what we proved by , the model of lending, the model of statement provision, certainly the HMRC use cases. Now they are VAT, PAYA self assessments and good corporation taxes, life products, they&#8217;re high quality users because they&#8217;re making a payment, they&#8217;re doing something with it. And it&#8217;s not just a product. It&#8217;s not just a polling one also. I posted it the growth is absolutely incredible, really do. The quality of&nbsp; what&#8217;s happening is unbelievable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:27:56] The HMRC one is very interesting to me because that takes one of the biggest headaches that people have away from them. If they can do in a way where they don&#8217;t feel, they definitely have to go to an accountant or they have to rely on their accountant or they have to do something and they&#8217;re not really fully aware of what they&#8217;re doing. And I think that happens to everybody along the journey. It&#8217;s never as simple&nbsp; as it looks&nbsp; it might be. So we have a few years now and we&#8217;ve from 2018 to now. Where are we going from here?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Simon Lyons: <\/strong>[00:28:20] So you just said HMRC so&nbsp; let&#8217;s look at Breslin. When I walked through the door, I was hell-bent that I needed a trusted precedent. And there was a little bit of dialogue with HMRC that begun and it&#8217;s been shaped. So I&#8217;m looking off to lead the engagement with the UK government open banking. In the last three weeks, I have spoken to&nbsp; about 60 different departments. Over the last year I&#8217;ve spoken to about 80. We&#8217;ve got statements of interest from sort of most of them HMRC, obviously leading them a way. There&#8217;s a really, really important thing in the HMRC usage, which is it sets the precedent of people to trust it. So it sets it. Now when you get that as well, when you get fiscal usage, as we&#8217;ve looked for, for many, many other payment things, any other initiatives, if the government use it, then it&#8217;s safe. You just need to look back at faster payments. In 2009 under PSD one PSR one&nbsp; to see where that went. Where did we go? For me I can only talk about a segment of it, but the segment I would talk about is, is there is enough demand known realization within the market. There is benefits to open banking for direct populations and indirect populations. So let me give you a couple of examples. How about you walk down the street and you&#8217;d take out your phone and there&#8217;s a retail store near you and you check if the phones get any catch in it because the store doesn&#8217;t want to hold cash. You make an open banking payment and you get a QR code. So you can walk into that store to withdraw well that&#8217;s life that works. That&#8217;s in place. And what that&#8217;s doing is, is that access to cash. It&#8217;s allowing banks to work because the more efficient we&#8217;ve potentially got a local banking, but much more importantly, we&#8217;ve got a very secure environment to get cash. It&#8217;s not people standing on the street by an ATM. Utility bills, enormous problem, poverty tariffs. So I&#8217;m trying to pick up really, really caught use cases here. There is a large population of the country that doesn&#8217;t let using direct debit. Fine. Could be cashflow, could be under the reason. And so they get penalized. So they either get a standard tariff or the independent prepare me to where they&#8217;ve got to pay the highest tariff. So we&#8217;ve got it wrong around there. The lowest earners pay the highest tariff. So with open banking, we can do something different. Generally&nbsp; the exclusion point, there was the, either the lack of card or the lack of the ability to take a regular payment. So now, because anybody can make an open banking payment, we&#8217;ve turned it from being financial excluded to being digital excluded. So if you&#8217;ve got a mobile phone and a bank account, then you can potentially top up your smart meter soon from the comfort of your own home, not the post office, not retail outlet, that&#8217;s gone to it. You can work it. That&#8217;s high value. The reason it&#8217;s high value is the cost of those services to run to the utilities are absolutely astronomical. They are so expensive. The manual ones are always the most expensive. All the things that come out, let&#8217;s imagine you just missed your direct debit. Helene you know, you would have for your gas and you ring up and you want to pay, you&#8217;ve got to pay by card over the phone, or push a payment where you set the reference. How about we send people a link and we say, we&#8217;ve got to trust that we&#8217;ve got the gas company and we&#8217;ve got Helene and the gas company, Hey, on you&#8217;re on the phone. I&#8217;m going to send you a link right now. Okay. The benefit that&#8217;s lovely, isn&#8217;t it? It&#8217;s a great payment, not the benefit of shorter calls times. And one of the biggest expenses, the utility set is, outsource calls and the big warehouses full of people that they have to have. You see that the benefit sometimes isn&#8217;t banking, it&#8217;s actually indirect. There&#8217;s a number of other things. I mean, I&#8217;ll touch on something if I may. There&#8217;s a law in the UK around something called real-time information. And that information is collected by everybody who has a salary paid by backs. It was mandated, I think in 2010, it was put into the back service. And this service is only available to back to users. Now, if you&#8217;re an SME and you try got it backs, it&#8217;s pretty tough because it&#8217;s a credit sanction. It requires risk. So how about we use open banking so we give number one SMEs or bulk method of payment, which they currently don&#8217;t have. And then number two, we put that data that the tax man needs in the payment next to it. And then number three, we give the accountant the ability to input a payment and the business of prove it, which doesn&#8217;t exist in the law business channels. But much more importantly, we give the banks not sensitive to backs as well. So you&#8217;ll see that open banking in that respect is aggregated with other data, but we&#8217;re bringing along such a high value use case. Now then you can extrapolate that and take that across to so many other use cases, data with a payment, not inside the payment. So the growth, I believe in my world&nbsp; comes from a great deal of indirect usage from our large corporates that penalize people for the payment method or penalize them for not sharing their data from that comes a great deal of initiatives from the FinTech world, where they build a market for us. Do you mind if I just expand on something since the memory of man if we build out a channel or a solution, we&#8217;ve spent hundreds of millions of pounds on it. API stop that because it means that the solution is market led by smaller, more agile FinTech companies. By more open-minded company, not by the usual enormous implementers. Look at bank platform replacement. Look at&nbsp; things you could talk about companies that provide KYC and AML. Now you could talk about payment providers, identification, verification. Everything now is much more slick and leaner. Well, the benefit of that means that our big corporates and our government can build a standard and allow the market to fill the void in four weeks. And we did it last year in four days. So I think that that&#8217;s the growth. I think it comes from indirect and direct access to deliver high benefit solutions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:33:29] Which I love. And I love the fact that it makes a financially excluded or financially marginalized part of the population able to enjoy being more in the more mainstream and not feel disenfranchised. On the API there&#8217;s a couple of someone mentioned to me last week, he said, well, I&#8217;m using open banking and it takes me to a page that looks like it&#8217;s a scam page, but I don&#8217;t know what the actual transaction was. You mentioned SMS as well. And this is just got me thinking about the fact that some of&nbsp; the scam, again, that we&#8217;re experiencing is coming through the through the SMS. So the tech side is the security and the technology&nbsp; and the API is which I think I understand from some people fall down often, not all the time, is everything in the tech side of things up to the standard that we need it to be, or is there more work to be done there?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Simon Lyons: <\/strong>[00:34:17] I don&#8217;t think I can comment on that until technical stands. I can only say one thing that I hear the nervousness about pay by Lincoln, pay by what you get. If you get an unsolicited email from any party, be it a bank post office, then you should ignore it and you should not act on it. And unfortunately they prey on the least digitally savvy. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s an open banking issue. I think that&#8217;s a. A trust issue between who you&#8217;re dealing with. I saw the post office one recently that got sent out and it was brilliant. But where are the standards as they are at the moment as well, they will evolve. They will get better. They are using bank consent. You know, let&#8217;s not be under any illusion said they&#8217;ve got it. But as somebody that&#8217;s done way too many frauds and he and his life and watch people crying at desks because they&#8217;ve been sent an invoice saying we&#8217;ve changed our bank details. Please update your details. You have to get a certain level of cynicism into the population. However they receive information. Don&#8217;t act verify, ring up first. That&#8217;s my advice always, by the way, I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any security that can fix that. Somebody will always breach it. Otherwise we wouldn&#8217;t need any well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:35:13] I&#8217;ve had at least five of them, myself. One of them was the postal office. One of them was a phone company. I mean, literally they keep coming and you think, well, that looks pretty. We&#8217;re all busy. I can understand how it happens all the time, but is it making people jittery? I don&#8217;t know.&nbsp; Because it is happening. It&#8217;s happened more over the last year and a half because we&#8217;ve been doing everything online.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Simon Lyons: <\/strong>[00:35:29] I&#8217;m sorry to interrupt it.&nbsp; It is really the important thing here as well as. There&#8217;s a very interesting argument and it&#8217;s a discussion I&#8217;m not proposing something. Did we tell people it&#8217;s open banking? Because if we look at the moment on the pretty much successful payment pages, they&#8217;re not so open banking and I&#8217;ll give you an unbelievable stat. I&#8217;m not going to tell you who. So there is a proposition out there at the moment launched in March, very successful transmitted, a couple of hundred million pounds, and there&#8217;s not been one email or one phone call to say, what is this payment type? What does it, however, Cole was put into a financial organization and yesterday, day before yesterday, no, Friday. And so they don&#8217;t know what this is that. That finacial institution said, well, we think it&#8217;s a fraud.&nbsp; What you need to do is we&#8217;re going to change all your passwords and reset and reach with new cards. And it was&nbsp; open banking link that was called pay by bank transfer. Now the problem there is, is that the finance institution weren&#8217;t aware of it. So, number one, what we&#8217;ve got is because of the usage of the banking channel in open banking, you are redirected to a source of trust. You can see who you&#8217;re paying the adoption is really, really good.&nbsp; It&#8217;s far better than we&#8217;re taking you to blue diamond sausage page. And this is on your payment page. You&#8217;re actually dealing with some people very familiar with. There&#8217;s a very interesting point as to whether we educate people what open banking is or we educate people about trust, who you&#8217;re dealing with. Now. I am not way too far down the food chain to comment on whether that dialogue is mine or somebody else&#8217;s, but there&#8217;s definitely a point to say, I&#8217;m dealing with united utilities. I trust them. I&#8217;m dealing with HMRC. I trust them. I&#8217;m dealing with just giving a trust to them. Whereas I don&#8217;t trust somebody I don&#8217;t know. So a one that will evolve from me. What I think, I think it&#8217;s one, that&#8217;s got a big place in this discussion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:37:11] Hmm. Very interesting. You&#8217;re right. I had this discussion about wealth robo-advisory. The people need to know what&#8217;s going on in the black box? If the goals are achieved, does it really matter? Do people really care as long as they get to go? Is it discussion? I mean, there&#8217;ll be some geeks and some techies that are gonna want to know every step of the way, but you&#8217;re right. If people are achieving what they want to achieve and it&#8217;s in a trusted environment, I think probably not. Simon., I can remember the Saturday afternoon when all this came to be and watching the journey and hoping that it was going to benefit SMEs and I&#8217;m very bullish on. I&#8217;m very bullish on open banking. I think&nbsp; it&#8217;s yet to really come to its full measure. I think SMEs during the pandemic really understood. Well, I can see how this is going to benefit me. So I said silver lining sometimes come out of horrible things, but now I want the wider population to be able to see it. So I&#8217;m really interested in watching. Thank you very much for creating the ecosystem and for being there on this leg of the journey. Well, this leg of the journey was important.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Simon Lyons: <\/strong>[00:38:13] There&#8217;s so much more to do in making people aware of, I don&#8217;t know how you make people aware of something that I&#8217;ve just said you don&#8217;t want to tell them about this. It&#8217;s very, very difficult . I&#8217;ll give you a little bit of a synopsis of what I think will happen if I could predict the future. We need brilliant technicians to build up banking, right? We got them. We got an unbelievable level of technical capability. The problem we get then is, is that what we&#8217;ve got to do is look at the people who are going to consume it. And what we&#8217;re going to do is consume it as use the language for that audience. We have to break down open banking into where it works. SMEs you just talked about. So what do our SMEs want? And we&#8217;ve got a set rate and we&#8217;ve looked at the city of London sandbox that&#8217;s in there in place. There&#8217;s some wonderful things going on consultation from HMRC on the 16th of July, about VAT and split payments as a tax, compliant bank count. All of those things are going to play with open banking. But the big thing is, I see open banking is the final piece of the trivial pursuit board, because from that we can build out so many different things. It&#8217;s allowed us to access differently. And I look forward to industries and populations looking at this and going, Hey, that helps me. That makes my life easier. And it&#8217;s talking in my language at me, at my problem. Exactly my construction and that I believe is where we get the rich success. We&#8217;re doing a little bits of it, and I&#8217;m very, very proud to say that some of the stuff we&#8217;ve done has been incredibly successful and at high adoption as well. But you remember as well, I&#8217;ll say verbally with three years in. It&#8217;s taken us 108 years to get over the check and we don&#8217;t manage that yet and we still got them at each &nbsp;back there in the 15 hundreds doing lending as well and we&#8217;re still lending on pretty much the same basis. So you&#8217;ll lot over there in Italy,&nbsp; running it in Venice, but we&#8217;ve got to talk to populations in the right language. And if we do that, whatever happens will be very, very, very exciting. And I&#8217;m privileged to have a senses&#8230;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:39:56] Honestly, it&#8217;s just kinda, you are just talking, I&#8217;m thinking, Hey, chapter one of the books. So I blow my own horn remedies in finance. We go back to the ,the other thing is&nbsp; when people want to talk about funding with SMEs they don&#8217;t go in there and say,&nbsp; I&#8217;m looking for a Excel spreadsheet for cashflow forecasting. They go in there and say, I&#8217;m actually looking to see if I have enough money to buy or do whatever I want to do. So the way the phrasing of it is, the way we go.&nbsp; People don&#8217;t wake up and say, I want a mortgage. They want a house. So they want a flat. It&#8217;s the same thing to get us used to thinking, well, here&#8217;s the benefit for me, but I get to say it in my language and it&#8217;s going to respond in my language. For me we&#8217;re on the we&#8217;re at the beginning of it and I can&#8217;t wait to see where this is going. I&#8217;m really pleased the rest of the world is starting to look at it. I think it&#8217;s only been a couple of years, as you say. It was going to happen. I look back now and laugh at some of the people who said that it wasn&#8217;t going to carry on and I will sit with you and look forward , and we&#8217;ll have another conversation in a year and see where we are as well on this.

Vacuumlabs engineers develop and maintain the official Cardano libraries for both Trezor and Ledger \u2014 the two dominant hardware wallet vendors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, we want to take you on a tour through this odd world. Over the years, Vacuumlabs engineers have gained extensive experience with this technology, so it seemed fun to share some of the learnings with fellow developers\u2026<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What is a hardware wallet?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A hardware wallet is a physical device that stores the private keys to sign cryptocurrency transactions. Every address that holds cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum or Cardano is composed of two keys: a public key and a private key. The public key is roughly the equivalent to a username or bank account number \u2014 something that other users can recognize as a place to send tokens to \u2014 while the private key is the equivalent to a <em>password<\/em> to log into that account. The private key is needed to sign or \u201capprove\u201d outgoing transactions from the account.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an environment without any middlemen or options to roll back or reverse malicious transactions, anyone who gains access to the private key of a given account has the ability to steal all the funds on that account without any way to reverse the theft. And given that anyone can easily find out which accounts hold large balances with hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars worth of tokens, the protection of public keys is an important matter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to best protect the private keys, private keys should never be stored on a computer or mobile phone, or even be typed in via a keyboard. After all, whoever gains access to that device \u2014 through a silent key logger or other malicious software \u2014&nbsp;might be able to extract the private keys and run off with the money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A hardware wallet looks roughly like a USB thumb drive, and acts as a box that physically stores the credentials to a crypto wallet, in a way that is entirely isolated from the computer it plugs into. When the hardware wallet is connected to a computer, a user can access his wallet account and prepare a transaction on the laptop. When the transaction is composed, the transaction will be streamed into the hardware wallet \u2014&nbsp;the USB-connected device \u2014&nbsp;and the hardware wallet will upon approval of the user sign the transaction using the private key stored in the hardware wallet. The signed transaction can then be passed back into the computer and published on the blockchain\u2026 but, importantly, without the private key ever having left the hardware wallet. Even the computer where the transaction was composed only sees the signed transactions, but not the private key that signed it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s say that user Bob wants to send 100 tokens to Alice. From Bob\u2019s perspective, the process would look like this:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Bob connects his hardware wallet via USB to his computer. He then opens his wallet provider of choice (such as AdaLite).<br><\/li><li>Upon login, he is prompted for authentication. Bob uses the buttons on his hardware wallet to enter his PIN number, and then unlocks access to the wallet.<br><\/li><li>On his computer, Bob can now see his token balance, and compose a transaction. Bob enters Alice\u2019s public key, and sets the amount to 100 tokens.<br><\/li><li>Bob now needs to confirm and finalise the transaction. The wallet provider then streams the transaction data into the hardware wallet.<br><\/li><li>On the secure display, Bob can see the details of the transaction: the amount of tokens, the address it will be sent to, etc. Bob confirms on the hardware wallet that the details are correct.<br><\/li><li>The hardware wallet now uses Bob\u2019s private keys to sign the transaction.<br><\/li><li>The signed transaction is returned to the computer, and streamed out onto the blockchain. In the next block, Bob\u2019s transaction is included, and Alice receives the tokens.<br><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Writing software for hardware wallets presents some unusual challenges for developers&#8230;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A hardware wallet of course needs to have some software to be able to execute the operations it needs to perform: ingesting the unsigned transaction, displaying it to the user for approval, generating the signature, and then pushing the signed transaction back out.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the private keys for multiple cryptographic assets you might hold on a hardware wallet are all generated from one common seed, each separate blockchain requires its own implementation to sign valid transactions, and thus requires its own little \u201capp\u201d on the hardware wallet to get the job done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because security is the primary (if not only) concern for a hardware wallet, writing code for it presents its own and somewhat unusual set of constraints and challenges. In the rest of this article, let\u2019s explore some of them:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Hardware wallets are extremely limited in resources, especially memory<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A hardware wallet has to act as a vault to store and protect the private keys within them. This means the wallet needs to be secure on the software level, but also on the hardware level to protect against hardware exploits. The hardware is very carefully chosen to minimise risks of hardware exploits, and since the memory is obviously the most vulnerable part \u2014 since it stores the private keys \u2014&nbsp;memory of hardware wallets is intentionally extremely limited.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a matter of fact, very few hardware options actually exist that offer strong security properties against physical attacks and exploits. Both Trezor and Ledger have settled on using flash memories that are <a href=\"https:\/\/ledger.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/userspace\/troubleshooting.html?highlight=RAM#not-enough-ram\">extremely small<\/a> by today&#8217;s standards, Ledger Nano S having literally only several kilobytes of it.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From a developer perspective, this implies that you cannot really hold anything in memory. In fact, development of hardware wallet firmware feels similar to developing for early game consoles: a developer needs to very carefully use and reuse memory, to be able to execute its program and avoid crashes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>The limited memory availability complicates many things a great deal. For instance: you often cannot simply iterate over a data set, but rather need to be extremely explicit and precise about what you need or not need, in order to preserve memory. In the case of Ledger, where you work with the C language, you can easily end up writing things that overwrite the memory or otherwise make low-level mistakes on memory management.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s important to note that the memory limitations are created <em>on purpose<\/em>: while it is easy to produce powerful computers, it is very difficult to make powerful computers secure. Progress on hardware wallet development isn\u2019t focused on increasing the computational power of the devices, but rather to keep them simple (and likely more secure). As such, hardware wallets are likely to remain limited in their capabilities for the foreseeable future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. You are stuck with a very limited language to express yourself<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For most jobs, developers have some freedom in picking their language, libraries and tooling of choice, but not for hardware wallets. Each hardware wallet will limit you to whatever the SDK offers you. In Ledger\u2019s case, that means you\u2019ll have to make do with a limited subset of the C language. Trezor is not much different, with Micropython \u2014&nbsp;a limited subset of Python \u2014 as the language of choice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The limiting language and absence of any libraries means that developers work on a very low level of abstraction, and have to build everything pretty much from scratch. It is back to basics, in a big way. The reward, of course, is that it is also quite cool to go back to basics, rather than build on layer upon layer of work that others have built before you.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Debugging is limited and\u2026 buggy<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The nature of a hardware wallet is that it is a black box \u2014&nbsp;that is the whole design, after all. It also means that debugging is relatively tricky. In the case of Ledger, until recently you had to constantly reload the compiled app into the device every time you change anything. Now <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/LedgerHQ\/speculos\">an emulator<\/a> is available, although it emulates the device only to a limited extent. Trezor is a little better with a somewhat more mature emulator to aid in debugging, however it still doesn\u2019t 100% mimic the behaviour of the actual Trezor hardware. Debugging a hardware wallet is a bit spartan, and lets you appreciate the great debugging support we have available in other fields of software development.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Security is the essential consideration in your software design<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Needless to say security is constantly top-of-mind as you write the software. This is reflected in the high-level design of the software you write, but goes down to the lowest level. You are building the software equivalent to a vault, so everything needs to be meticulously secured and safeguarded. Under no circumstances should private keys be leaked out of the device or should users be able to sign transactions they didn\u2019t intend to. Any edge case \u2014&nbsp;no matter how unlikely \u2014&nbsp;needs attention and careful management.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Backwards compatibility and change management is tough<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, change management is a constant concern. The field of blockchain technology is constantly evolving, and Cardano \u2014&nbsp;our main concern \u2014&nbsp;is constantly rolling out new functionalities and capabilities. Those changes to the protocol need to also be translated and reflected in the hardware wallets and software that supports it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the ecosystem changes, coordination is needed between the various components. In an ideal situation the updates on a protocol level should immediately be reflected in the various wallets and light wallets that support the ecosystem, and that should in turn be in alignment with the hardware wallet implementations.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you submit changes to the hardware wallet code, constant care is needed to not break any existing integrations \u2014 such as software wallets interacting with hardware wallets \u2014 when the update goes live. There may be delays of days or even weeks before hardware wallet updates become available to the end-users, so you usually need to update the libraries used by these integrations ahead of time with backward compatibility adjustments, preventing outages as the hardware wallet update is rolled out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>My personal perspective on writing software for hardware wallets<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Personally, the experience of writing software for both Ledger and Trezor wallets has been both interesting, challenging and rewarding in unexpected ways. While the above challenges make it tough to write good software, these constraints also force you to go back to basics, and work on a very low level, intimately close to the hardware constraints.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyone who has a computer science background will remember professors nerding out over particular kinds of algorithms and their rather academic intricacies. When you are thrusted into the working world, it seems that you never see those algorithms and low-level problems again.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Writing software for hardware wallets is probably the closest I will ever come to writing and analysing these algorithms myself. It&#8217;s very unique that you actually use the algorithmic knowledge that you learn about in computer science class. The challenges are far more \u201cpure\u201d in a computer sciences sense than the problems one faces in, say, a web development job.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hardware wallet software feels like a pretty cool combination of high-level things \u2014 such as the software design \u2014 and also super low-level problems like security, far-fetched edge cases, and so much more.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are the kind of senior developer that is interested in new challenges and working in an environment that pushes you to grow further and strengthen your fundamentals, then Vacuumlabs might be just the place for you.

Many businesses continue to spend significant amounts of time on recurring tasks that, until now, have required interactions with financial institutions. We sat down with Nick Heller, CEO of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tomatopay.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">tomato pay<\/a>, and Kevin Stefton, co-founder of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.untied.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">untied<\/a>, to talk about how Fintech is offering businesses dramatic time-saving opportunities..\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>To start with, what exactly is embedded finance?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Embedded finance takes financial processes like invoicing, requesting loans, and recording tax information, and integrates them directly with a business\u2019s digital systems. This connection between a business and its financial service provider removes the need for them to spend time executing tasks in person.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Nick Heller\u2019s words, <\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201c<em>Embedded finance moves financial services into the background where they become a passive operation.<\/em>.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s about practical things like automatically sending invoices when a job is done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Embedded finance can help business owners in a variety of ways &#8211; some of them unexpected ways. For example, they can automatically categorize transactions so that tax reporting is taken care of in real-time. . Similarly, they can combine embedded finance with open banking to truly understand their bank accounts &#8211; when they can expect payments and when extended cash might be needed. All of this without a need to log into internet banking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cWe often see people worrying about how to get on top of this admin work. And the more we can take advantage of data that already exists, the more powerful this is.These things just happen automatically in the background.\u201d &#8211; Kevin Sefton<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The evolution of financial services<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The finance industry\u2019s incumbents are often innovating, , and embedded finance is no exception.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While customers benefit from convenience and time-saving, it\u2019s a win for the banks, too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cBanks gain greater visibility on when they will be paid . If you&#8217;re an incumbent bank and you&#8217;re offering a service like that, it opens up a wealth of possibilities. Not only are you able to better service your customers, you&#8217;re also gaining helpful intelligence on them. You can use data points to find the optimal moments to offer relevant services.\u201d &#8211; Nick Heller<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to hear more of Kevin\u2019s and Nick\u2019s thoughts on embedded finance, head over to the full\u00a0 Banking on Air episode.

I&#8217;m your host, Helene Panzarino and as ever I&#8217;m never alone on these podcasts. And today I have two guests. I&#8217;m very excited to say. And the topics that we&#8217;ll be delving into is Embedded finance. Embedded finance. What is it? What influences it? What are the use cases and what are the benefits? Embedded finance has been touted as potentially the thing that will change FinTech as we know it. And FinTech was the thing that was touted as changing financial services, as we know it. So it could be one of those topics that has real weight. So before we get stuck into all and all our subscribers get to hear&nbsp; the journey let&#8217;s get some introductions. So today I&#8217;m joined by Nick Heller from Tomatopay&nbsp; or Tomatopay , if you&#8217;re in north America potentially, and Kevin Sefton, who&#8217;s the CEO of Untied. Nick, should we get an introduction from you and tell us what the company is doing and then we&#8217;ll talk more about and embedded finance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nick Heller: <\/strong>[00:01:09] Thank you. Helene. I&#8217;m really happy to be here to talk about a really exciting and important topic around embedded finance. As you mentioned&nbsp; Nick Heller co-founder CEO of Tomatopay a London-based open banking powered payments platform that helps small businesses get better access to financial services.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve been operating for a few years now and we really have been on the forefront of open banking and PSD2&nbsp; and really excited to discuss this topic, which is hugely important to small businesses in the UK and all around the world, which is bringing banking and financial services into the day-to-day operations of their business, so they can get on with doing what they do best, which is&nbsp; pursuing their passion to&nbsp; create a better environment for their communities through their chosen line of work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:02:08] Thank you very much. It sounds like it&#8217;s got some powerful stuff to&nbsp; discuss today. Kevin?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Sefton: <\/strong>[00:02:15] Good to be with you today and with Nick as well. I&#8217;m the co founder of Untied. Untied I just the UK&#8217;s personal tax app, and more generally a trusted layer between financial transactions, the tax system and people. And we&#8217;ll be seeing how that will be changing over the course of the next couple of years. And we&#8217;re here to make taxes simple and straightforward for the majority of people who want to be compliant, but they&#8217;re not tax experts. So our philosophy is that people should be able to manage the taxes compliantly and reduce the tax they pay by being an expert in themselves, not an expert in taxes. So there are a couple of big trends Nick&#8217;s already touched on open banking and we use open banking transactions to start the gathering process of understanding someone&#8217;s tax position. And we go all the way through to submitting straight to HMRC. There&#8217;s a big change, which is happening in tax from April, 2023, which is called making tax digital for income tax. And from that point, anyone who is self-employed or property landlord turning over more than 10,000 pounds will be required to use new third party software. And that&#8217;s what Untided is here already recognized by HMRC to be doing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:03:28] Kevin, it&#8217;s really good to hear it because I can imagine you both know that I&#8217;ve worked with like literally tens of thousands of SMEs over the last 20 odd years or so. And I can imagine the shivers that go down people&#8217;s spine at the very early stage or the microend of their business when they hear that they have to do things digitally from an HMRC perspective. Anyway HMRC&nbsp; for global view&nbsp; is the tax authority in the UK. But of course, anywhere you are in the world, when you are a small business, Tax is one of those things if it&#8217;s not your force, and as you said, Kevin, they have, and Nick you&#8217;ve alluded, they have other things to be getting on with like running the business, anything that helps and anything that can draw on permission data to look at the analytics of that and to do something useful with it. Reconciliation and tax as an automatic thing has got to be good. So we&#8217;ve got embedded finance, we&#8217;ve got open banking, which is the regulation driving some of the ability to share the data, not just in the UK or off the back&nbsp; of PSD2&nbsp; in Europe, into the UK and now we&#8217;re seeing it obviously globally open banking is really coming on a pace.&nbsp; And then of course the impact on small businesses, which is something that all of us are passionate about, and we&#8217;ve seen at the end of the last year and some change, how small businesses have been now designated as the engine fraternity in the corner, in a post COVID world. And so we better come up with some good and useful things to help them do that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think globally, they account for a large percentage of GDP. I think we all would accept that as a green, but how do we help them? So, Nick, again, we have a variety in our listeners and our subscribers have levels of understanding in financial services. So maybe we can start off with what is the definition of embedded finance?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nick Heller: <\/strong>[00:05:18] But embedded finance. So it&#8217;s a hot topic these days. And I think&nbsp; I&#8217;ll start off with a very simple definition, but then maybe talk a little bit more about the drivers,&nbsp; similar to what Kevin mentioned. So firstly, I think we&#8217;re all used to doing financial services. It&#8217;s a hugely important sector of the economy.&nbsp; And banks are literally too big to fail because they play in a very important role in everything we do as individual consumers to business owners. And that&#8217;s really to store value to hold our cash, to help execute payments and move money around and to do lending. And traditionally we would get up, out of our house and walk down to the high street and go into a branch and do banking. And that was everything from depositing money to making a payments through to applying for a loan. And it was a very active activity. You would actually have to physically do it. And I think embedded finance talks about moving financial services into the background where it&#8217;s more passive. And I think although banking is hugely important, it&#8217;s not something that everyone aspires to do unless you work in the industry. Actually, if you&#8217;re a small business owner and your job is to be a landscape is escape architects, but to be a contractor or a plumber, you want to spend your time actually getting more customers doing more jobs, you don&#8217;t want to spend your time doing the admin associated with running a business. Very simply embedded finance is about moving from a very active role and administering financial services and actually running a business, or even as a consumer, actively seeking out financial services to a more passive operation where it&#8217;s embedded in your day-to-day life. It&#8217;s embedded in your daily life as a consumer, as you&#8217;re going about your day, you&#8217;re actively engaging with various aspects, various people and financial services can be embedded at the point of need. A short example,&nbsp; could be on the consumer side, as we see sort of the growth of the internet, the commercial internet, and ultimately technology and the internet of things, which we&#8217;ve heard a lot about over the last 10 years. You open up your fridge, you realize that actually you need more milk and if the fridge is connected to your supermarket, then you can purchase some milk immediately right there via the internet. That in my mind is an embedded financial services transaction as a consumer. More importantly, in the topic at hand that we&#8217;re discussing as a small business owner, if you&#8217;re actually a landscape&nbsp; architects, and you&#8217;re just finished a job at one year customer&#8217;s houses, you&#8217;d want to build that person immediately, but generally speaking, you actually have to go back to your desk. You have to create an invoice. You have to align that with the contractual terms and then offer that over to your customer. And there&#8217;s a lot of back and forth and a lot of friction. What embedded finance can provide is immediacy. And at that point of relevance, in this case, as you&#8217;re walking out of the house, you&#8217;re, you&#8217;re thanking your customer. You actually able to request the payment immediately. They&#8217;re able to pay you. They&#8217;re able to get that information directly into their own hands, and you&#8217;re able to get that information reconciled, ultimately doing some of the magic that untidy and Kevin you&#8217;re able to understand the tax liability around that. And all of that is happening in the background while you&#8217;re going about your day to day operation.&nbsp; In short it&#8217;s about embedding financial services into the day-to-day life of an individual or a business and being more passive and removing that friction and ultimately helping&nbsp; everybody.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:09:18] It&#8217;s interesting because listening to you. And when I started this, I mentioned that people are talking about embedded finance as being the thing that will disrupt FinTech. Wasn&#8217;t FinTech when we set out, when we use the Monaco in 2011, 2012, for example, wasn&#8217;t it meant to be real time transparent, seamless? Don&#8217;t we always say this is supposed to be, you&#8217;re not supposed to know that it&#8217;s happening, right? It&#8217;s supposed to be efficient and transparent and cost-effective and happening in real time. And in a way, this embedded finance is bringing us to the Zenith of what FinTech was set out to be when we all started down this road. So it seems to me that they kind of go hand in hand and actually this is the pinnacle of what FinTech could be. It&#8217;s interesting that some people are putting out a sort of a potentially doomy gloomy situation when actually I think this is a great situation for it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nick Heller: <\/strong>[00:10:11] Well, we&#8217;re about to cross the chasm, I would say, into the mainstream because of internet penetration, because of the fact that you can embed financial services into everything that we do. Actually brings us into the enlightenment time of FinTech, which is actually everyone can become a financial services provider without being a traditional bank, which has a massive costs associated with it, not only in terms of regulation, but also in terms of setting up that type of operation. So this actually pardon to use another buzz word, but it sort of democratizes and it&#8217;s distributed financial services that can be anywhere. So I think this is actually a great time to be in quote-unquote FinTech.&nbsp; We&#8217;re just sort of about to cross the chasm into mainstream and it&#8217;s a really exciting time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:11:00] Okay. I want to come back to two things that you mentioned. One is this non-financial institutions getting into this and the Anna&#8217;s Andreessen horse Horwitz down the blog. I think it was everyone&#8217;s becoming a, a FinTech. And then also what I start to speak about the impact or the potential impact with incumbent banks. But before I do that, Kevin, Nick mentioned that let&#8217;s take the example of the person that&#8217;s coming out. They&#8217;ve done some work for you. They&#8217;re the carpenter, the plumber, et cetera, whatever they are and generally speaking,&nbsp; there&#8217;s always been a lag in terms of small businesses and micro businesses in particular, the sole trader, the self-employed person getting paid and it causes a cash flow problem. So presumably what you&#8217;re doing is actually going to transform this part of the MSME or MSMB market. And also just to get your take on how open banking is helping to enable this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Sefton: <\/strong>[00:11:51] I think really contextual side that Nick really sort of highlighted is the important thing and embedding this at the point of need. I&#8217;m hearing in that scenario that you just described two really important points of need. The first one, if you were the trades person, you&#8217;re going to have invested potentially in subcontractors, you&#8217;re going to have materials that you&#8217;ve bought and so on. Now there&#8217;s a potential need to make sure that at the time that you go and purchase these materials or that you&#8217;re paying a sub-contractors that you&#8217;ve got the cashflow that you need there. And one of the things that really strikes me is I often get invited to take up loans at a point when I&#8217;m just not interested. And to be honest, at the point when my bank balance is going up and down, I&#8217;m not fully on top of it to know exactly when I need it. But here&#8217;s a really good example. I&#8217;ve got a contract, it&#8217;s evident. I&#8217;ve got a customer who&#8217;s going to be paying me. I may have payment terms, being able to make sure that I can fund and support my sub-contractors and various other things within that network. And of course, the second thing is that the point that I complete the work and my then puts on the payment requests to Nick, who have done the work for, and then suddenly Nick might have a need to say, well, actually, my cashflow is a little bit tight at the moment. I need to be supporting myself here. And all of that, of course, from a lending perspective can be backed up by evidence that you&#8217;re going to be seeing through transactions through open banking. I think the ability to collect that payment really quickly is so important that we so much time reentering bank account details. You repeat it over the telephone, the speed of the ability to make payments using this sort of technology that Tomatopay&nbsp; has is really quite exciting. And I just sort of, I guess, was it&nbsp; want to touch on some of the tax things that will have happened as well in the background. So if I&#8217;m in the construction industry, I may have subcontractors and various documents need to be filed in relation to my payments to them. Again, all of that can be tracked the behind the scenes invisibly for me as a trades person, using some of the transactions that we see in going through the bank account. And I think that&#8217;s very exciting in terms of removing. The day-to-day admin that someone needs to do as a trades person. My passion is likely to be that I&#8217;m a carpenter or plumber. Not that I enjoy doing my paperwork.&nbsp; We often see people really worrying about how they need to be getting on top of this admin. And the more we can be taking advantage of the data that already exists. I think the more powerful this is, and for these just thing, these things just happen automatically in the background.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:14:27] Kevin, can I ask you a question? And you mentioned the data, and again, I can totally appreciate where this is coming from with the angst that is around doing all the facts and all&nbsp; the reconciliation behind it. Is there any element of, and this is going to sound potentially like a silly question, but is there any element of data in has to be correct and accurate for the data out to be the same? I&#8217;m thinking about back to using other tax systems, online tax systems that I&#8217;ve used, which are a bit more complex than just the an Excel spreadsheet and watching people enter data. And it was &nbsp; garbage job because I didn&#8217;t know how to actually set up the categorizations to get it correct. So the dashboard became useless than anything else that was coming off the back of it, was relatively useless. Is there any elements of that that we need to consider? Is there any education that, that the business owner needs to have with the sole trader needs to have to get this right&nbsp; at the point of entry?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Sefton: <\/strong>[00:15:18] Short answer is, of course. You need to make sure that the data which is coming in is correct and is appropriately categorized. But I also think there is an opportunity coming back to the analytics to help people get things right. But if we know the sort of trade that you&#8217;re likely to be in. We would have a very good idea, the sort of level of profitability that we&#8217;re likely to be expecting. So if for some reason something&#8217;s been mistagged, we&#8217;re likely to be picking up that sort of thing. And Nick was talking about the democratization process here. At the moment, the tax authority has access to this sort of algorithms. So they know whether this looks reasonable from their point of view. And I think it&#8217;s incumbent on the system as a whole to be sharing that so that we can be helping people make sure that they are staying aligned. We do see, there are people who willfully want to take advantage of the system and simplifications, and this is not for them. This is for someone who wants to be following the rules. Doesn&#8217;t have the expertise to be able to identify certain things, but we can help them and guide them along the way with contextual information questions that we&#8217;ll be putting to them at the right time. So instead of a long form that you might set up at the start of a process, if a transaction comes in, they will be able to wisidise&nbsp; effectively solving that and getting that right. There is a categorization paradox, which I just want to pick up because I think in the context of open banking, it&#8217;s important, which is most categorization looks at the nature of the merchants. For the work that we need and I think the next generation is actually about contextual categorization relevant to the individual. So that if we all go to Ikea and buy something and I&#8217;m a trades person, I&#8217;m buying that as materials. Helene you&#8217;ve got a property that you&#8217;re renting out. It&#8217;s part of your property costs. And Nick has just bought a beautiful new bookcase for his living room. It&#8217;s the same transaction, but it has got a different context and relevance to each of us and making sure that we get that right is important, but the best time to get that right, is that the point of a transaction being made not many, many, many months after the end of a tax year, because I&#8217;ll be honest if I look at my receipts, so if I look at my bank statement and I see a transaction with Ikea 18 months ago, I&#8217;m really at a bit of a push to try and remember what it was that I bought. So let&#8217;s do it while it&#8217;s fresh in our minds. And I think that&#8217;s one of the most exciting things that people will always be on top of this and know what they need at that point without shops coming later on in the day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:18:03] That&#8217;s very powerful actually for me, I can see&nbsp; there&#8217;s a great benefit there. Nick. I want to go back to something that I said, I wanted to talk about the incumbents because I&#8217;m listening to the payments, I&#8217;m listening to the two of you working together in certain ways. So if I&#8217;m the incumbent bank, if I&#8217;m not, the large high street bank, am I getting sidelined in all this conversation?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nick Heller: <\/strong>[00:18:23] Well, I think there&#8217;s a few different ways that we can look at this and I think in some senses and in some ways they are. But it&#8217;s also up to them because if they want to actively participate in the evolution of financial services, then they won&#8217;t be sidelined at all. And so I will bring it back to the end user again, and then incorporate the bank, the high street bank, the incumbent banks into that process. So an example of what Tomatopay brings is the idea of this quote to contract, to invoice. So supporting a service person, a trades person, as they&#8217;re developing business in there in the initial communication with their customer. How they&#8217;re providing a quote, which then turns into a contract, which then ultimately turns into an invoice. And if you&#8217;re helping them with that process and you&#8217;re removing the friction from that process. You&#8217;re doing them a service so they can get on with doing their job and ultimately earning more income and revenue. But in addition to doing that, it also means they have greater visibility on when they&#8217;re going to be paid. You can apply the categorization to the data on their side and on the consumer side, which then makes sure that you&#8217;re properly able to analyze it. And importantly as Kevin said, you&#8217;re able to apply tax treatment to that. Now if you&#8217;re a bank, if you&#8217;re an incumbent bank and you&#8217;re offering a service like that, it opens up a wealth of possibilities. Not only are you better engaging in servicing your customers by giving them the opportunity to gain time back by using a very sophisticated yet easy to use invoicing platform, but you&#8217;re also gaining interesting data and intelligence on those customers. So not only will you see that they&#8217;re going to be paid in 15, 30 days time. You&#8217;ll see the transaction, you&#8217;ll see the tax treatment around that. You&#8217;ll see that data point and you&#8217;re able to offer financial services to that customer then at this point of relevance. At this moment in context. Do you want to finance that invoice before it arrives? Do you want to take out some sort of a merchant cash advance and repay a loan based on future revenue? All sorts of opportunities arise with embedded finance. And so if you&#8217;re an incumbent bank, you likely have a whole lot of customers already. You likely have,&nbsp; hopefully a healthy balance sheet where you can do more lending, but you&#8217;re not currently embedded in the day-to-day operations of your customers. And so this gives them an opportunity to actually be very valued, offer a win to the end business, the end consumer, offer a win to the incumbent bank who can put their balance sheet to work by lending in a faster, more efficient way, because they have better access to data and ultimately have a better view of risk and lower risk when you&#8217;re doing things like revenue based finance. So I think the opportunities here are huge for incumbent banks, but it&#8217;s their decision of whether they want to participate or whether they want to sit on the sidelines and use the traditional methods of banking, which we know are becoming increasingly outdated and are very expensive. So don&#8217;t actually add to the profitability of being a bank.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:21:52] That is fascinating and I think that really puts it very succinctly as to how, particularly for the segment that we&#8217;re looking at, the SME, the SMB of a certain size, not the larger corporate, whether the banking arrangement might be different is giving in this case, we&#8217;ll talk about the incumbent or the high street bank, a leg up on actual leverage to be more productive, to be more efficient, to get more money out the door and actually to empower the relationship manager, if there is one and it&#8217;s not just a, an automated group, somewhere in the middle of the country. Like mine is, I&#8217;m just saying. If there&#8217;s an actual human being that you can speak to, they get more insight from the data as well as me as the business owner. And it becomes a relationship again. And we&#8217;ve kind of gone a little bit back in time to relationship banking, which is what it was back in the day than when I started out and you knew the person. And we see this obviously in the smaller banks in a more community or in a mutual or in a building society way. Generally speaking, we know we have a relationship and that was that trusted relationship has come back to the four again, during the last year saying, these people knew who I was and it wasn&#8217;t just all automated. And there was an element also, I think&nbsp; when Kevin was speaking before of AI machine learning coming into play, because the more you get to see the transactions in a certain category in a certain level, you can start to read and predict where things might actually sit. Not in terms of the financing they need, but also what the HMRC people will expect. And that is super powerful because over time I can remember back many years ago saying to taxi drivers, HMRC has a rough idea of what you are in. So if you take a lot in cash and you don&#8217;t take a lot in another way, they&#8217;re going to know. And it was always a kind of mental striking of the balance, but actually you&#8217;ll get it very clearly here. So that&#8217;s fantastic. And do you think that. With alternative lenders as well, some of the alternative finance platform lenders came into being when incumbent banks were not able to, or wanting to whether it is for regulatory reasons or for risk reasons to lend to this fragmented risk, you know, And all the things that you could say about SME lending and these they came to be. Are they going to find that it&#8217;s if income it&#8217;s get more power or get more back in the game that this will impact their lending, or should they also be getting on board with this?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nick Heller: <\/strong>[00:24:12] I think to keep up with the times everyone should be on board. The alternative lenders sort of gain&nbsp; prominence after the last financial fallout of 2008. But if you looked at their early business models, primarily they were just a lender that slapped a website onto what was a traditional lender and became digital. And they weren&#8217;t encumbered by the legacy technology. So we&#8217;re able to utilize some ways of adding efficiencies and lowering costs of how they would originate and service a loan. I think that&#8217;s evolved though. And I think that both them and incumbent banks are looking for a partnership groups to leverage what they have, which is essentially a balance sheet they&#8217;re able to lend and embedding themselves through any number of different partners so that you&#8217;re in the day-to-day life and operations of a business. The incumbent banks obviously will always have an advantage of a lower cost of capital. So I think there is a little bit of a threat there from alternative lenders, but alternative lenders have just been traditionally faster and better at lowering their costs. And in turn, have it have been faster to adopt these new technologies, like open banking and others. I think that the playing field is starting to become a little bit more level and that the banks, as they lower their costs are able to go down to the smaller sole traders micro SMEs because of their cost of origination and servicing is lower as a result, they can get profitable at that sector and that&#8217;s going to impact a lot of alternative lenders. So I think everyone has to be thinking about using technology like Tomatopay and Untied and embedding themselves in the day-to-day life of these businesses. That&#8217;s I think just the trend that is not going to stop. It&#8217;s only gonna raise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:26:01] I wish that people could see what&#8217;s the excitement that&#8217;s happening inside me, even though we&#8217;re just on the airwaves cause this is very exciting. I don&#8217;t want to put a damper on it, but I want to ask a question about nonfinancial institutions in this space because&nbsp; there are online marketplaces that we have our data and have our trust to a certain extent. And if it comes up in the transaction to do something, am I likely to do that?&nbsp; If it pre-approved me for something or lets me,&nbsp; buy now pay later, but I can start the process now. And it&#8217;s happening in the transaction, it&#8217;s happening for real, as you said, and we discussed that that would be FinTech,&nbsp; at its zenith. Are they a threat or are they a partner or that, where do they fit in all this?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Sefton: <\/strong>[00:26:46] I think they&#8217;re a huge partner in this. I think there&#8217;s a significant opportunity for all of these platforms from many, many, many different perspectives. And your question there was really, I think, a little bit guarded towards financial services, but actually there&#8217;s so many things which are happening in terms of compliance and the need to make sure that that is actually dealt with at the point where it&#8217;s actually relevant. Now we talking about FinTech, but whether it is compliance in terms of product compliance, electrical regulations, product regulations, we&#8217;re all buying stuff from a global marketplace today. And I still want the absolute assurance if I&#8217;m buying something, which is advertise in a certain way, it is going to be safe. And particularly if it&#8217;s something maybe that children are going to be playing with, is it a toy which actually complies with all the regulations and embedding that in that marketplace is going to be critical and the same applies then to all the financial services that exist on the back of it. And I&#8217;m going to give you a little bit of a parallel. If as a business I&#8217;m buying things from a marketplace in theory, what I would like is that transaction automatically landed on my, against my VAT account and it landed against my PNL. And the data can flow if we want it to flow. And I think what we&#8217;ll find is that the marketplace is going forward. It really working to the business community will find that this data moves in a much more streamlined way. And I don&#8217;t even need to do anything, but suddenly it&#8217;s there appropriately categorized. The tax claim is made and that&#8217;s good for me as a business. And it also happens to be good for the tax authority. And on that note, the tax authority often has to know collect money we&#8217;re obviously in a post-Brexit world, but goods coming in and out of the country, making sure that that is done in a way where the tax authority gets the money that they need to allow the goods to flow through the border as quickly and seamlessly as possible. And it does strike me that one major software supplier I&#8217;m dotting around a little bit, one software supplier that we use over the course of the last 12 months, the tax treatment of the services they&#8217;ve supplied to us has changed three times. So if that&#8217;s changed three times Just for one business, how many other things other that we need to be keeping track of? And I think the platforms are a great place to be doing that whether that&#8217;s Spotify, whether that&#8217;s eBay, whether it&#8217;s Amazon, whatever it could be, or some of the big B2B platforms. I think it&#8217;s tremendously exciting to be getting that context there. Probably also come back to your question about banks because I think one of the real challenges for banks is the SMEs that Tomatopay, Untied and others are really focusing on sit between two stools in these banks. We&#8217;re not proper large scale business customers who are happy to have a relationship manager pay however much money a month&nbsp; for business banking services, which we can&#8217;t quite identify the distinction and we get a little plastic thing that colored reader, which are very complicated. And yet what we want to be doing is we want to be using our personal current account to be managing what starts off as a hobby, becomes a side hustle and then may become self-employed activity at a larger scale. And the banks are very awkwardly uncomfortable about that because they said, well, you&#8217;re not really meant to be putting business transactions to your personal current account, it&#8217;s against the terms of conditions. So I think the opportunity, whether it is for new entrance or for incumbents really sits in this space, which is going to grow between a business account and a personal accounts. And those, the succeed will be the ones that offer services that are relevant to those in that space. And I think it&#8217;s too early to predict where&nbsp; the hook is going to be. It might be your bank account. It might be a shopping platform. It might be a card. It might be that you are literally looking to make a payment request and you come straight to Tomatopay and you see the explosion that starts around smarter pay,&nbsp; and other services because of that. And I think it&#8217;s going to be really exciting to see where these hooks actually are over the course of the next couple of years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:31:11] It&#8217;s a very good point because it is like, no man&#8217;s land, isn&#8217;t it? In terms of a bank, you don&#8217;t want to overpay for something that you don&#8217;t need, if you&#8217;re not of the size. And then you get all muddled by using your personal credit card, your personal cash, trying to extract it from your personal account, put it in the right categorization to do your taxes. This is like an age old problem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Sefton: <\/strong>[00:31:28] It shouldn&#8217;t matter. It shouldn&#8217;t matter which account it is. And I think that&#8217;s the key thing. Philosophy in the past, we&#8217;ve kept things very separate and now we can, it&#8217;s really exciting you can intermingle it. And then suck out the data using the technology and the analysis to make sure that we identify what it is relevant, whether it&#8217;s something to borrow against or it&#8217;s something for other admin purposes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nick Heller: <\/strong>[00:31:50] And why are we still trying to gouge businesses for fees when there&#8217;s a 22 billion pound funding gap in the UK and a 4 trillion pound funding gap globally,&nbsp; they want a loan actually, so they can grow. And if that&#8217;s where you&#8217;re going to make higher margins anyway, and that&#8217;s the core of what you do then I think that fee business where you&#8217;re gouging should just go away. And to answer your point in my view, I mean, I think it&#8217;s a huge partnership opportunity for incumbent banks. I mean, you see Goldman Sachs with Amazon, you see Goldman Sachs with Apple. Those are maybe a bunch of hundred pound gorillas dancing, but the same thing goes, if you&#8217;re Spotify, as an example, you see who&#8217;s a hit maker and you see the trends happening with those artists. You&#8217;re not a lender, but you might be a broker. And actually in this world of embedded finance, if we could also call this connected finance, and maybe who it&#8217;s going to disrupt is that, the brokers, because the brokers that sort of intermediary. Do they really need to be there? Are they changing because they&#8217;re actually embedded finance offers a solution? Whether you&#8217;re you know, a taxi marketplace or a food delivery service, and you have all these different sides of consumers, the sole traders that are working for you, the businesses. You have all of these different elements that is just flowing through and seeing that data that you can actually broker a bunch of different services, whether it&#8217;s tax or lending or other things. So I think&nbsp; that&#8217;s the real exciting part if I&#8217;m a bank, I want to do what I do best, which is lend and have a balance sheet and find the opportunities of where these customers are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:33:30] Right now, if we go back to us in the beginning about saying, this is very disruptive, this is really game changing. And I think for our listeners and our subscribers, now you have a much better understanding, I&#8217;m sure, of what it is, what the power of embedded finance or connected finance is. Where all the stakeholders and partners and players along the way can benefit. Where they may have to make some conciliatory noises take a bit less, but also empowering the business owner what be they a sole trader or a very small business as well. This to me is a quiet revolution and I&#8217;m so glad that the two of you are working together to make this happen. I feel quite privileged to know you all, and I think we should all have that same feeling and listening. So I think we&#8217;re up at the nearly at the top of the hour so it remains&nbsp; to say thank you to Kevin and Nick and to encourage all of our listeners to stay tuned because we may revisit this topic again.

Currencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum are valuable not only because of the technical innovations at the platform level, but also because of the ecosystem of application developers, corporate users, research bodies, liquidity and staking providers, educators and evangelists, and so much more.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wallets provide amongst the most essential of ecosystem services, enabling users to receive, hold and send their coins in a way that hopefully is both secure and easy to use. As a development agency that is currently actively involved in the crypto space, we\u2019re proud that we have been able to play a direct and significant role in the success of two primary Cardano wallet providers: AdaLite (which we <a href=\"http:\/\/link.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">wrote about earlier<\/a>), as well as the ever-popular Yoroi Cardano wallet, for which we developed much of the mobile implementation. We\u2019ve spoken about AdaLite before, so it is about time we shed some light on the development of the Yoroi mobile wallet as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What is the Yoroi wallet about?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Yoroi wallet is a light wallet developed by EMURGO, one of the main development bodies supporting the Cardano project. Light wallets enable users to interact with the blockchain \u2014&nbsp;to send, receive and hold Ada cryptocurrency \u2014&nbsp;without the headaches and complexities of having to run a \u201cfull node\u201d wallet. Along with the Daedalus wallet, which is the Cardano official full node wallet, the Yoroi wallet represents the most prominent Cardano light wallet developed by the official Cardano core developers. Yoroi in particular offers access to the Cardano blockchain via a Chrome extension as well as a mobile application.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The EMURGO team tasked with developing what would become the Yoroi wallet started off with the browser extension implementation but ran short of development capacity for developing the mobile version of the wallet. Since Vacuumlabs engineers already had a\u00a0 proven track record of reverse engineering the Cardano Haskell codebase to enable the AdaLite wallet, it was clear that we would be amongst the most qualified developers available to help out in developing the Yoroi mobile implementation as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Challenges in building the Yoroi mobile wallet<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, building a project like a cryptocurrency light wallet is never without problems. Given our experience with AdaLite, we already had intimate knowledge of the blockchain we would be building for, but the particularities of the mobile implementation of a light wallet still provided more than enough of a challenge along the way.<br><br>The first problem? Hardware encryption on Android.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>The state of hardware encryption on Android<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in 2018, the state of hardware encryption on Android devices was a nightmare. Since we were developing a wallet that will potentially hold and secure millions of dollars worth of cryptographic tokens, encryption and security is the primary concern.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyone who interacts with the blockchain would of course like to encrypt his credentials to the blockchain. Ideally those credentials are stored in the device\u2019s \u201csecurity enclave\u201d, which acts like a vault inside of your mobile phone to store sensitive information like your private keys and guards it against other (potentially malicious) apps. The problem here was that in 2018 the secure part of the system was still very much evolving and maturing, and each version of Android had a slightly different API. In effect, this meant that for various types of Android devices running multiple versions of the Android software, we would each be developing version-specific code to ensure security. We spent quite some time to make sure to have proper support for all the Android versions up from Android 5. Developing very specialised code for each of these versions effectively meant an enormous weight on the technical team.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Keeping properly synchronized transactions<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides keeping all the various Android versions secure and optimised, we also ran into problems of transaction synchronization to the blockchain.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most fundamental and key properties of a blockchain is that at any time a blockchain might reorganize itself to keep following the longest chain of transaction blocks. This means that at any time reorganisations might happen where the last few blocks of transactions disappear and become invalid, and the network switches to following a different (longer) chain. From a technical point of view as a wallet developer, this means that the last few transactions could disappear because we effectively roll back a few blocks, and new transactions appear instead.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to keep things functional, wallets need to know at any moment in time exactly what the current state of the blockchain is. The hard part about this is that you need to design the system in such a way that it can recognize these reorganizations, and synchronize them correctly. A mobile wallet needs to be built for handling situations where such reorganizations happen while being offline. Yoroi had to cache the transactions, load them at the appropriate moment, and load things incrementally in order to avoid overloading the server.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to the first problem of keeping Android versions secure, this challenge was quite different in nature, and more of a conceptual challenge where you need to think through how to approach these state synchronization issues. We ended up writing a very detailed technical document to outline how synchronization would have to be approached for the Yoroi wallet and then implemented things accordingly.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>A successful EMURGO collaboration<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It ultimately took four of our developers 3-4 months to build the mobile implementation of the Yoroi wallet, and we\u2019re incredibly proud that the Yoroi wallet is and probably will continue to be one of the most heavily used crypto wallets for the Cardano protocol. As the Cardano network further expands and matures, so will the role of its wallets increase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are grateful for the direct collaboration between the technical teams of both EMURGO and Vacuumlabs, where our engineers got to spend a lot of time with the senior technical staff of EMURGO. We constantly worked in a way to enable the first versions of the Yoroi mobile wallet to be shipped to EMURGO early in the process, so we could together iterate on it to add functionalities and capabilities. We started very simple, so people could already test it and play around\u2026 and then simply built from there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since our successful collaboration on the Yoroi project, Vacuumlabs and EMURGO have spent more time together building further projects and also collaborate actively with IOHK \u2014\u00a0the other core development team of the Cardano project \u2014\u00a0to offer hardware wallet implementations for the network.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All in all, our engineers are proud of having built not only the first and still most popular web-based Cardano wallet (AdaLite) but also the mobile implementation for the even-more-popular Yoroi wallet. It has been an exciting experience to be involved in the Cardano project, and we are even more excited about the future of Cardano.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to hear more about Yoroi project, listen to our Banking on Air episode:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"post__player player\"><iframe border=\"0\" class=\"player__iframe\" src=\"https:\/\/anchor.fm\/insidethevacuum\/embed\/episodes\/32-Yoroi-and-future-of-blockchain-with-Vicente-Almonacid-EMURGO-e11ilih\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" scrolling=\"no\" frameBorder=\"0\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n\n\n\t\n\t<div id=\"podcast-subscribe-button-3988\" class=\"secondline-psb-radius-style\">\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n<div class=\"secondline-psb-subscribe-icons\" style=\"margin-top:-2em;margin-bottom:1em;\"><strong>WHERE TO LISTEN<\/strong> &nbsp;

The first episode focused on basic crypto terms &amp; explanation of how it works; the second episode was about Ethereum and smart contracts. The third episode &#8211; as always, moderated by our host Helene Panzarino &#8211; brings the topic of decentralised finance and NFTs!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>So first of all, what is decentralised finance?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cAs the name suggests, it is a parallel financial universe that consists of decentralized smart-contracts-based applications that perform functionalities that we usually see in financial institutions, banks, and so on.\u201d &#8211; David Stancel<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>And so what is the difference between \u201cstandard\u201d functionalities and the ones in blockchain?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cAs they are performed in DeFi\u00a0 (decentralised finance), the pieces of code are uploaded on some blockchain networks, such as Ethereum. They are basically unstoppable in these distributed networks, impossible to temper with. They are fully automated and together they create a beautiful, very exciting universe of applications and actually create products that we didn&#8217;t have here before.\u201d &#8211; David Stancel<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Use cases of decentralised finance are various &#8211; first came decentralised exchanges (so-called order book exchanges, AMM (automated market makers) which are one of the greatest innovations so far in DeFi); then there are for example lending protocols or synthetic stocks. All of these run on smart contracts and thus different rules apply to them &#8211; they might not have the same limitations or restrictions that are in place in regular trading venues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>NFTs &#8211; non-fungible tokens<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cFungible tokens are \u2014 by their definition \u2014 interchangeable: each Bitcoin is the same as every other Bitcoin, much like every US dollar is equal to every other US dollar. NFTs on the other hand are <em>not<\/em> interchangeable: each token is unique, which gives non-fungible tokens a unique set of traits or properties that enable them to do all sorts of other things.\u201d &#8211; David Stancel<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The hype came in 2017 with CryptoKitties when it paralized the whole Ethereum network. Currently NFTs are popular among artists or gamers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the future of NFTs according to David? They will be present in segments such as education and will create digital assets for example for university diplomas. Also thanks to COVID, the whole world is getting digitized so there is a lot of space for blockchain, decentralised finance or NFTs to leak into our everyday lives.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019d like to learn more about smart contracts, Ethereum and related topics, don\u2019t miss our second crypto episode with David Stancel.

I&#8217;m Helene Panzarino and I&#8217;m your host and we are continuing our series on all things to do with Bitcoin blockchain. And today it&#8217;s decentralized finance and NFTs at for this series as usual I am not alone. I&#8217;m joined once again by David Stencel .David welcome back and for those of who miss, who somehow missed episodes one and two of our series, should we give them a little bit of a background on you?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Stancel: <\/strong>[00:00:34] Sure. Hello, everyone. Happy to be here again. As I mentioned already, before I&#8217;ve been researching cryptocurrencies for quite some time. Now I&#8217;ve been advising a lot of companies and startups and projects that have been working in the cryptocurrency area. And I&#8217;ve been also teaching at the university, this beautiful subject of cryptocurrencies and the blockchain and in my free time I also&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; work on a book that is concerned with the history and the evolution of cryptocurrencies as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:01:04] I feel your pain there, David&nbsp; the book writing thing is, you know, a couple of them in there. Listen. So I said, thank you for joining us.&nbsp; I said from the beginning of this, that we&#8217;re carrying on with our theme and this time we&#8217;re getting into something where&nbsp; DeFi , decentralized finance and NFTs, which we kind of alluded to a little bit in episode one and I thought might be a fad. So as we dig into this deeper, we can talk more about what this is and why is it still with us and will it stay? So last time we spoke a lot about theory and how it was different from blockchain and we&#8217;re getting into a lot of the unstructured during of these discussions and descriptions and definitions. Decentralized finance, what is decentralized finance?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Stancel: <\/strong>[00:01:53] I think decentralized finance is one of the most exciting&nbsp;&nbsp; use case of&nbsp; the whole blockchain world. As the name suggests it is a parallel financial universe that consists of&nbsp; decentralized, smart contract based applications that perform functionalities that we are usually accustomed to see in financial institutions, banks, exchanges,&nbsp; hedge funds and so on. But these functionalities are performed in DeFi by these pieces of code that are uploaded on some of the blockchain networks, such as Ethereum and because they are uploaded there in a distributed network, they are basically unstoppable oftentimes. They are impossible to temporary. And they are fully automated and together they create a beautiful, very exciting universe of&nbsp; applications and actually also products that we haven&#8217;t had here before.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:02:59] And again, as I&#8217;m listening to you, I&#8217;m thinking of, for those of you who miss&nbsp; the previous episode, go back on there and have a listen to what we talked about. Smart contracts being probably misnamed and I think you mentioned that Itali, as she said, that probably was a poor name for what they are, because you just said again, their applications, right? I did not realize though that we were going into a parallel universe, I have to be completely honest. Okay. So this is good. This is good. Now you mentioned that there are products and their services and that it&#8217;s happening in parallel to what we&#8217;d normally be doing in financial services. So what&#8217;s some, a couple of examples of products and services, and which are the most popular that would be part of that other world?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Stancel: <\/strong>[00:03:41] Because as every financial system at the beginning, we need to create lots of kind of financial primitives that are the core of the whole system and upon which other applications can be built. And therefore&nbsp; some of the first use cases we could see in this area of DeFi&nbsp; were always some exchanges. These exchanges usually functioned a little bit differently to the regular exchanges that most of the traders are used to so-called in an order book based exchanges. What was one of the greatest innovations so far in DeFi was the invention of the concept of&nbsp; AMM&#8217;s automated market makers, which probably one of the first exchanges of this kind was Uniswap, which is kind of a multi-billion project that was initially founded by a single guy with a grant of $60,000. And this was probably like three years ago.&nbsp; Now this decentralized exchange has the volumes of like 10 billion a month or something. And it&#8217;s probably the major trading venue for everybody in DeFi. And maybe to clarify, how is this different and what kind of advantages it offers to traders, is that in a typical order book based exchanges, you always need to have two parties. Someone who wants to sell somebody who wants to buy, whereas in the AMM&#8217;s all this is basically performed by the smart contract. So you don&#8217;t need to find the second party that you trade with, but this smart contract always gives you a quote&nbsp; on the trade you want to make. So the main point is that it makes also all kinds of assets, a much more liquid than it would usually be. And&nbsp; that&#8217;s&nbsp; why , it was kind of easy to bootstrap in the DeFi space because there are so many tokens and they had very little liquidity and thru this automated smart contracts, they became more liquid and more easily tradable and of course, that was a very desirable from the perspective of the teams developing these applications. So this decentralized exchanges is definitely the first product to move forward&nbsp; some of the other very important product and protocols in the space include the lending protocols. These are protocols that basically allow you to borrow some assets. You are still talking about crypto, so there are no fee and money involved. It&#8217;s always about the crypto assets, different kinds of crypto assets. Some of them might be stable coins, but some other assets, of course, including stuff like Ethereum&nbsp; all kinds of DeFi tokens, which we can explore later on. So these are the protocols where again, we don&#8217;t necessarily have the&nbsp; counterparty during the lending, but we have a smart contract that performs these. Smart contracts that can hold onto collateral. And against this smart contract, people can borrow and land assets. So these are one of the most popular applications in DeFi so far.&nbsp; Then we have a bunch of others, like a different derivatives platforms that allow us to create some synthetic assets. Recently, there was a lots of hype about these protocols because basically they allow some people like profit traders, let&#8217;s say this point, to trade really like stocks, but on the blockchain, which are synthetic stock so they are not legacy regulated stocks that we know from the legacy financial road. But these are just tokens that have synthetically created and they are value expected to the real world counterparts to the stocks of those companies. But the difference is of course it, because they are the blockchain world that different rules apply. You might not need to be KYC, it not provide your identity and stuff like that. There might not be some limitations or restrictions that are in place in the regular trading venues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:07:50] David, I&#8217;m listening to you and I&#8217;m thinking, okay, I get it. I can listen to you how the soul runs in a parallel world. Also derivatives in the real world are complicated enough, but taking them somewhere else is interesting. For me as the kind of woman on the street type thing the person that&#8217;s not into the technology side of it, why would I do this? What would I get involved in this instead of doing it in the other world, in the traditional financial world?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Stancel: <\/strong>[00:08:15] Why would you do it? So the truth is that probably something like 1,5 billion people in the world don&#8217;t have access even to the bank account, not to mention the access to the capital markets and the financial markets in general. So of course, all these DeFi systems and protocols are all permissionless. So that&#8217;s definitely one of the greatest advantage that could be accessed by anyone. Of course, in reality there are still more kind of play for speculators and traders that can afford, to lose lots of money. As we&nbsp; also mentioned in the previous episode, the Ethereum network has been congested a lot and the transaction fees care rocketed in the height of this fees made it kind of unfeasible for any non-bank people to interact with these protocols as of now. But of course the scalability is a big topic in the crypto space and there are many, many affords and initiatives to solve this problems and we can expect, I think, quite reasonably that in a matter of a one, two years, I think it can be again a much more accessible to many people that are non-banks as well. So for now it&#8217;s meant mostly for speculators and hopefully in the future, we&#8217;ll see more common people interact with these protocols.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:09:34] Well, yeah, it&#8217;s good to hear that because I kind of,&nbsp; when I think back to how all this started, it was about democratizing and taking away the real sense of authority and not being bound by specific regulations, but making them yourselves, so all consensus and agreements. And so it kind of flies a little bit in the face of having to exclude people if we can&#8217;t do that. So we&#8217;ll keep an eye on where that&#8217;s going. And another question in the terrestrial financial world, let&#8217;s call it, especially around lending for example, we have a lot of aggregator platforms where the information is together, you can access things. Does that exist in the DeFi world?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Stancel: <\/strong>[00:10:11] Oh, yeah. We do know what are called, like DeFi aggregators, or perhaps a kind of DeFi UI user interface aggregators, because now we have really like a whole spectrum of protocols. And for people like&nbsp; for the power users who have been using all of them, it&#8217;s quite hard to keep track of all of them. So what is now being created and becoming increasingly more popular are these kind of&nbsp; aggregator slash integrators where on one single page, basically you just log in with your Ethereum address which we also mentioned the last time that this kind of a single sign on for the crypto world. And these applications or these aggregators read your transaction history. They can tell you which protocols you interacted with, where are your&nbsp; assets, maybe what kind of yield is on those assets as of now, because this is something that is dynamically changing in the DeFi space, which is very interesting. And of course, there&#8217;s a very important to mention is that one of the incentives, and one of the reasons why people play around with these protocols is that yelds in these protocols are much higher than in a like a C applications, even on an stable coin. So having a dollar in the bank account and having the dollar on blockchain can be really, really different experience.&nbsp; Not only because of different UI experiences, but mainly because that in the DeFi road, you can get like easily, like 10, 12% per annum on your dollars.&nbsp; Kind of very low risk-free way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:11:53] Wow. Now I can see why people would then want to get involved as well. If we continue to stay the way we are in a traditional environment where there&#8217;s interest rates in new zero, most of the world. Is not very attractive, is it? You mentioned the blockchain and in this context, and is there a blockchain that&#8217;s the main DeFi venue?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Stancel: <\/strong>[00:12:14] Yeah, I think we mentioned it to us last time that the, for now it&#8217;s still Ethereum. Even though there are a lot of competitors, you know, entering this pace and trying to compete with Ethereum. But even though most of them actually are trying to more kind of compliment Ethereum and be sort of an extension of Ethereum itself. So that&#8217;s why most of them kind of copied the Ethereum virtual machine. So all the smart contracts on top of Ethereum are easy to deploy on these other&nbsp; blockchains. And that&#8217;s why also we see that there are lots of so-called bridges being built, where you can transfer easily assets from Ethereum to these other blockchains, such as Cardano, Solana, near Avalanche and so on and so on. So you can transfer assets between these blockchains in a easy in ideally trustless way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:13:11] Okay. So that makes sense as well as it gets more congested, you need&nbsp; other ways to be able to literally, I suppose, move it around. You spoke about the fact that this, a lot of this is industry people that have been in it and they&#8217;re in it intensely and that it hasn&#8217;t yet rolled out to let&#8217;s call it the general public, because partly to do with these problems to do with the technologies and other things. But one thing that has captured the imagination, I think of the general public is NFTs. And there&#8217;s those people sitting on either side of the debate here, aren&#8217;t they people saying, what is this? You know, is this real?&nbsp; Is it virtual art? Is it real life? What&#8217;s the deal in the token there? What&#8217;s fungible mean? For example, when it says non fungible token, is it something that&#8217;s going to stick around? Is it something that&#8217;s a fad?&nbsp; I was listening to someone last week say, well, maybe we should get involved in this and someone else saying, well, no, we get enough about that. This is not going to be around for much longer. It&#8217;s just something that&#8217;s fad. So let&#8217;s roll it back again as we have been doing. What is an NFT, cause it is capturing the imagination? .<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Stancel: <\/strong>[00:14:14] NFT&#8217;s are basically tokens like any others, but unlike the regular tokens, which are kind of&nbsp; interchangeable because they have the same quality, same properties and that&#8217;s why we call them fungible non-funded, but tokens are unique in some ways. So they usually have a kind of unique set of traits or they are basically unique. And each of the NFT tokens, it has some unique properties. The first wave on the hype of NFTs was like in end of 2017 with CryptoKitties, which caused lots of hysteria on the market and basically at some point, this single applications almost paralyzed the whole Ethereum network. At that point in time, then during 2018-2019, it was the whole market was dead for a long time. And now we could see in the last few months, again, kind of resurrection of the NFTs, which became very popular, especially among the artists that found a way in NFTs to monetize their art and digital art usually. Even though they are in some cases where it was that with physical art. So long story short NFTs can represent multiple kinds of assets. Typically they are use for art as mentioned, but probably kind of more meaningful use case for those for NFTs will be game assets from different virtual worlds. Because a lot of gamers deal with this problem that they invest lots of time and resources in building their characters in some particular games. And they collect lots of virtual items, but once they decide to leave that particle ecosystem, it&#8217;s not liquid. They don&#8217;t have much to do with their assets. And the NFTs and the common standard for the NFT trading Ethereum blockchain allows all these assets to become more liquid and that&#8217;s of course, very desirable for many people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:16:16] So I suppose in a way,&nbsp; I remember for many years back now, probably around 2012-2013, there were people that were trying to help gamers to monetize without having just the publishers make all the money before they actually were able to monetize themselves. So this has been a problem that&#8217;s existed in that space and that, and the professionals for quite a while. And I get, and as I&#8217;m listening to you, I&#8217;m kind of thinking of the parallels and what happened with music as well. In terms of artists who were losing their rights or people were copying it and they were finding different&nbsp; ways to actually make sure that they got compensated when it went out onto like streaming platforms and things like that as well. I&#8217;m kind of stretching thinking, well, I see the Mona Lisa one tokenized and&nbsp; an NFT but&nbsp; as you said,&nbsp; it&#8217;s mostly&nbsp; digital art with a little bit of other that&nbsp; we&#8217;ve seen it in the public eye capturing the public life, but there&#8217;s a more serious side behind it for the gameing industry as well. What do you think, is this something that&#8217;s going to stick around or is this something that I don&#8217;t want to call it a fad, but is it a phase and will something replace it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Stancel: <\/strong>[00:17:20] I think what we could see in the past months, it was definitely a lots of hype with unreasonable expectations and some of the events that happened, I think there are lots of price level in the whole NFT market was unreasonably high in my opinion, on the other hand, I do believe there will be lots of meaningful applications there, because the whole world is getting digitalized and there will be just more and more digital assets, whatever it means it can be an all like your university diploma will be digital assets for the future. And, this is probably one way where we will see also application of NFTs in the future. Some universities already experiment with that. We will see if they will eventually call it NFTs or not, or if it will be just a digital certificate. But we will definitely see these kind of use cases more and they will sustain. For example, one of the very interesting applications in my opinion are that there are some of the VR worlds . They tokenize the land in their virtual world. And again, this land has a form of NFT tokens. And again, this is quite the lively market that has been going on for the last almost two years let&#8217;s say. Even though it was mostly underrated from the mainstream media, but it&#8217;s there, it&#8217;s growing. And it&#8217;s one of the, in my opinion, very convenient and appropriate use cases for it. Maybe to back to&nbsp; your questions. If we will see them on a Liza being tokenized once. We definitely can tokenize physical assets as well, but it comes with different trade of and different risks because always, if you want to tokenize something physical, you need to reliably connect it to the blockchain and it&#8217;s kind of an issue we can do it, but there is still some trust needed for it. And that&#8217;s why I think it&#8217;s kind of more complicated than NFT&#8217;s makes sense mostly in the realm of digital world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:19:23] And that makes sense as well, because if you think about it, as you said, how much digital data we have, and then you hear this kind of horror stories where people potentially pass away or something like that and no one knows where all these digital assets are because they haven&#8217;t shared keys or they haven&#8217;t shared in access to them in any other kind of way. And I guess as we move more that way, we need to find ways for us in our daily lives to be able to use that you mentioned the whole university side of things. When I think about it, I&#8217;ve had to get copies. I have a physical copy of one of my degrees certificates in a frame and every time I go to do something, I have to put it on a photocopier. It&#8217;s actually do something with it. It&#8217;s crazy in this day and age, right? But if something happened to that, hopefully that, the store that they have on them, I can go back to the birth certificates. I mean, there&#8217;s lots of things that I could imagine. From a practical point of view, that doesn&#8217;t mean that this shared ownership in any of this, clearly that&#8217;s just more like a, the storage and access side of things. And I think that&#8217;s interesting that it&#8217;s digital world as opposed to a physical world. And I think I feel a bit less cynical about it now, having had this conversation with you. And maybe to some of our listeners and some of us subscribers, they might feel the same thing and we might stay more in tune. Also it&#8217;s been really great to go through the DeFi because every time I hear it and everyone&#8217;s talking about decentralized finance, I think I don&#8217;t really understand what this is. We all want to know what these terms mean. And our whole journey from blockchain to Ethereum, to DeFi to NFTs, came about, because we realized that sometimes when you&#8217;re in the bubble, you don&#8217;t look outside and see how other people perceive it. We want to at Vacuumlabs, we want to share all as much information with us subscribers as possible. So I&#8217;ve enjoyed the series. Thank you, David, for educating us along the way. It&#8217;s been super enjoyable. We&#8217;re not in one of your university classes, but we&#8217;ve learned on the job as it were. And I hope that we&#8217;ll be picking up again and seeing where everything goes as this space evolves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everybody. Those of you who are subscribers. Thank you very much.

Today, I will take you on a technical behind-the-scenes, and show you how what was supposed to be a \u201cquick side project\u201d turned into some serious yak shaving. Enjoy!&nbsp;Ten years ago, we were young, foolish, and full of <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Theory_of_Money_and_Credit\">ideas about economic liberty<\/a>. So when Bitcoin came, we immediately had a hunch: this thing can be damn serious.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The worst part about Bitcoin is probably the proof-of-work. The mining process is not only wasteful, but what&#8217;s worse, it doesn&#8217;t seem to buy the system <a href=\"https:\/\/vitalik.ca\/general\/2020\/11\/06\/pos2020.html\">enough security<\/a>. Moreover, it&#8217;s hard to obtain instant finality with proof-of-work, and it&#8217;s not possible to fork out malicious block-producers. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BCeEjG3L-KM\">Siberian babushkas mining Bitcoin<\/a> is one of the few profoundly positive things I see about proof-of-work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So naturally, when proof-of-stake was invented, we were thrilled. However, first implementations such as Peercoin were a joke, full of design flaws, and easy prey for malicious actors. Then Cardano came and designed the system properly, faithful to its roots in academia, with the <a href=\"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/chapter\/10.1007\/978-3-319-63688-7_12\">formal proof of its properties<\/a>. Nowadays, many protocols have solid proof-of-stake consensus implemented, but back in 2017, this was huge.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In late 2017, we bought a few coins and wanted to store them securely. The whole ecosystem was relatively immature, so we decided to implement a good wallet that&#8217;d be secure enough, and that&#8217;d suit our needs. It seemed pretty straightforward; you do some crypto-mojo of hashing and signing in Javascript and broadcast the resulting transaction. This is kind of a task which makes you ask yourself, &#8220;OK, and what will I do in the afternoon?&#8221; Obviously, we couldn&#8217;t be more wrong.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong><em>\u201cThis will be easy\u201d<\/em><\/strong><strong>, we said\u2026&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cardano was just recently launched and \u2013 for most practical matters \u2013 basically in its alpha stage. There was barely any support for external developers or much technical documentation on any aspect of the blockchain. Worse yet: to most of the Cardano insiders, a group of very \u201cinterested\u201d Slovak developers trying to build a beginner-friendly wallet solution set off all their scammer alarm bells.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as we would soon find out, that was not our biggest problem. Our biggest problem was that almost everything in the Cardano world is written in Haskell&#8230;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Reverse-engineering the Haskell codebase<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What can you do if you want to develop a product on top of a new, primarily undocumented blockchain protocol? You look up the source code and figure out what&#8217;s going on.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we jumped into this, we faced a steep challenge: Cardano is primarily written in Haskell, a functional programming language. And while I was confident in my capabilities as a developer, learning Haskell was a humbling experience. The functional programming paradigm is a tricky one to wrap your head around, and a complex platform like Cardano isn&#8217;t exactly the best environment for someone new to get started. The scarcity of technical documentation forced us into a lot of trial and error until we figured out every piece of the puzzle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To crack this code, we started off by finding how to compile the Cardano node&#8217;s codebase so that we could put basic debugging statements in the code. However, little did we know, Haskell doesn&#8217;t allow a developer to simply put a print statement anywhere they like because the individual instructions inputs\/outputs are chained together. In addition, we didn&#8217;t know how to transform the data to be displayed in a &#8220;Haskell friendly way.&#8221; Each of these problems stemmed from the pure functional paradigm that Haskell is based on, which we were utterly unfamiliar with at the time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We ended up taking a step back and studying the basics of Haskell for a week or two before diving deeper. We were then finally able to figure out what the error messages meant and how to debug properly. From that point on, the progress was steady. We were able to inspect the code during runtime and get feedback on how our JavaScript code matched up with it. After being thrown in at the deep end\u2026 we were learning how to swim!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Another challenge: the Cardano crypto primitives<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once we had our first taste of the Haskell approach to everything, we started to get the hang of things. We weren&#8217;t on the timeline we had hoped for, but at least we had gotten some really interesting technical challenges to work through. As our project was slowly progressing and shaping up, it turned out Cardano had made slight modifications to their crypto primitives. These are things such as key derivation, signatures, etcetera. We found JavaScript libraries that seemed to be implementations of the same crypto primitives. Still, more often than not, they didn&#8217;t work out of the box and needed to be traced to where they differed from Cardano \u2014 a tedious and frustrating process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though our efforts to map Cardano&#8217;s cryptography to existing JavaScript libraries were quite tedious, we ultimately got there. After playing around with those crypto libraries, I suddenly realized that some of them were just transpired from their reference C implementation. The Cardano node, albeit written in Haskell, had its core crypto primitives mostly written in C. It turned out that, even though we had spent a month trying to find and tweak existing JavaScript libraries, we could quite easily transpile the C primitives into JavaScript as well and just be done with it. Once we had this, we made it into a standalone JavaScript library, and Cardano-crypto.js became the first JavaScript library with a comprehensive interface to Cardano cryptography, transaction signing, and address construction.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All this hard work came with a reward, though: the library was later picked up by other light wallets, most notably Exodus, which would otherwise have had to go through the same ordeal that we did. It was an enabler for Cardano light wallets, which are an essential part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, and play a key role in its adoption.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The boss fight: submitting transactions<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The final technical challenge to get AdaLite live \u2013 what can only really be described as the AdaLite &#8220;boss fight&#8221; \u2013 was that there wasn&#8217;t a high-level API to submit transactions to the Cardano blockchain. The code for that didn&#8217;t seem obvious, and the rest of the team and I had only limited Haskell experience at this stage. What we ended up doing was taking WireShark and tracing the traffic to the Cardano nodes when submitting a transaction and then figuring out what packets to send to make our transactions go through. It turned out the protocol was quite an exotic multi-round interaction with particular relay nodes. Fortunately, it was enough to hard-code most of it in our script, and then we were finally able to submit transactions. Low and behold\u2026 we had a functioning Cardano light wallet, and AdaLite was born!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Crypto interfaces are hard, too<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While building a functioning light wallet was the hard requirement, the <em>reason<\/em> we set out to create a light wallet was to make interacting with the blockchain much easier and more intuitive for users. For that, you need not only a functioning product but also an intuitive interface. As it turns out, building good interfaces and user experiences is also a complicated and ongoing challenge in the world of blockchain and crypto.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Crypto is a very young field, and compared to the conveniences of a Fintech or banking application; crypto UX is really in its infancy. While we as developers banged our heads on the keyboard as we struggled through the Haskell codebase, designers have to walk a fine line that balances between \u201ctransparent\u201d on the one hand and \u201ceasy to use\u201d on the other. AdaLite started as a wallet that simply allowed users to send, receive, and view their Ada balance. From that humble starting point, we slowly matured over time. We took a lot of inspiration from the MyEtherWallet Ethereum light wallet and then tried to simplify things even further. And as the Cardano blockchain matures and new capabilities are enabled at the protocol level, our designers are constantly challenged to develop UI and UX solutions that make things simple to use yet transparent enough to provide clarity and confidence. It is an ongoing balancing act.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8212;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All in all, the experience of working on AdaLite and working in the broader Cardano ecosystem has been both challenging, humbling, and ultimately rewarding. We came expecting a \u201cquick victory\u201d and instead ended up with some of the most demanding technical challenges we had ever faced. The Cardano ecosystem has since then become much more mature and is entirely different these days, with a lot of good documentation and other supporting infrastructure. It\u2019s an ecosystem that we are proud to be part of and proud to have played a role in shaping up.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are curious to learn more about the various blockchain projects that engineers and designers at Vacuumlabs work on, or play a role in similar projects and technical adventures, then please reach out to us, and get in touch. <a href=\"http:\/\/link-to-hiring-page.com\">We\u2019re hiring, and we are looking for you.<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In late 2017, we bought a few coins and wanted to store them securely.

This time, they focused on smart contracts, Ethereum, and platform interoperability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>To start with, what exactly is a smart contract?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cA smart contract is an application(a piece of code) that runs simultaneously on thousands of computers on a decentralized network. Anybody can join and participate in the network by running these applications. However once they are deployed on the network, it is almost impossible to remove them, stop them or tamper with the code. This is a unique trait of crypto and blockchain.\u201d &#8211; David Stancel<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>And, as mentioned in our first episode, <strong>this is one of the main reasons why crypto and blockchain were created<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where then, can smart contracts be used? Mainly, they are applied in financial services (DeFi &#8211; decentralized finance, exchanges, lending platforms,&#8230;), but also in the logistics, trade, and&nbsp; healthcare industries.&nbsp; Smart contracts run on blockchain networks like Ethereum, which is a decentralized, open-source blockchain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cThe Ethereum network stole the show by enabling developers to write \u201csmart contracts\u201d. While this was\u00a0 also possible on Bitcoin, it was in a very limited way.\u201d &#8211; David Stancel<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>However, using the name \u201csmart contracts\u201d wasn\u2019t the best choice. It turns out that they aren\u2019t so smart after all.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because of their architecture. These kinds of programs are just a regular piece of software. The more accurate term would be \u201cpersistent scripts\u201d, because they are deployed on decentralized architecture which is censorship-resistant.\u201d &#8211; David Stancel<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As already emphasized, it is almost impossible to change the code on blockchain, which prevents contracts from being interfered with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, Ethereum has lots of competitors &#8211; many new platforms are being created that are able to replicate the Ethereum virtual machine. In some cases, it is easy enough to transfer from one platform to another, using the same smart contract. But what is still questionable is interoperability &#8211; platforms still require third parties, so-called bridges, to enable communication with each other. According to David, we have approximately two years to wait until platforms will be connected in a way that won\u2019t require third parties to be involved.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019d like to learn more about smart contracts, Ethereum and related topics,don\u2019t miss our second crypto episode with David Stancel.

And today I&#8217;m joined yet again by David Stencel You might remember, or regular subscribers that we&#8217;ve started a cryptocurrency series, and we&#8217;re now in episode two. So the first one was really all about Bitcoin. You can go back and listen to that when you can subscribe and listen, the second one, we&#8217;re going to be looking at Ethereum. But also at smart contracts. So welcome David. David, for the people that haven&#8217;t listened to the first one, do you want to give a little introduction of yourself?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Stancel: <\/strong>[00:00:34] Oh yeah, sure. Hello everyone. Glad to be here again. I&#8217;ve been researching cryptocurrencies for over eight years now. Along the way I did some projects, so different kinds of projects like NGOs, as a medication activities, lot of advisory activities, some NFT startups and so on and so on. And currently I also teach at the university, this beautiful topic of cryptocurrencies and also as CTO at Fumbi which is a cryptocurrency trading platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:01:07] Well, I think we definitely came to the right guest then to explore this topic. And so I&#8217;ll also ask you to bear with us because there&#8217;s laypeople, which some of us will be some of the terminology, the vocabulary will be unfamiliar. So we&#8217;re going to try and unpack that because I think this is one of those things, of course in the news recently. We&#8217;ve all been watching what&#8217;s happening with Bitcoin. We&#8217;ve all been talking about central bank, digital currencies. We&#8217;ve all been trying to wrap our heads around what&#8217;s going on. But it&#8217;s , isn&#8217;t it? When you&#8217;re on the outside, so you&#8217;re on the inside. You can help us understand more. So I remember in around 2014-15 \u00a0 people started to talk about smart contracts and lawyers starting to shake thinking, oh, we&#8217;re not going to be here anymore. The same way that AI was going to take everybody&#8217;s jobs in banking and finance. So what is a smart contract really?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Stancel: <\/strong>[00:01:59] That&#8217;s a tough question because actually smart contracts are more similar to actual applications and programs then to the regular kind of contracts. Smart contracts are basically ordinary. They are not so smart actually, they are pretty dump usually.\u00a0 It just\u00a0 application like a piece of code of software that is being run on a decentralized network. So that&#8217;s basically the one single major difference between\u00a0 any kind of regular application that is run on a single server architecture and smart contracts that run on blockchain networks, such as typically Ethereum or others, where they are being simultaneously run on thousands of computers that are in the network. And of course this network has some peculiar functionalities and traits because it&#8217;s open, it&#8217;s a very decentralized, anybody can join the network and participate in the network by running these applications, which of course brings some challenges when it comes to building and deployment of such applications.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:03:09] David, can I ask you, you said it&#8217;s an application, which is interesting and also we could have gone down a whole bunch of jokes about smart lawyers, dumb lawyers. We will do that she says. Does it do something, does it trigger something by being embedded or part of that network?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Stancel: <\/strong>[00:03:26] I mean it does whatever we embed into it,\u00a0 whatever we program into it. Actually, even the co creator of Ethereum Vitalik Buterin, he was a retrospectively found out that we recognize that the term smart contract was not the best choice for this. Because as I said, there are these kind of programs that are like regular kind of piece of software. But the more convenient term for it would be persistent scripts because given the architecture, they are deployed on this decentralized architecture, which is very censorship resistant. One of the traits of these application is that once they are deployed on the network, it&#8217;s really hard or almost impossible to remove those applications to stop them, to tamper with the code and\u00a0 that&#8217;s probably why we are here and why we are talking about cryptocurrencies and blockchain space because this kind of unique trait that has not been present in our role. Before the invention\u00a0 of blockchain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:04:31] Okay, now I understand better and I see what you&#8217;re saying because I think you&#8217;re right. The term is slightly misleading and that probably confuses people. Now we&#8217;ve talked about what they are and from a piece of part of the tech of it, how do we actually use them currently? And that might be in financial services, but that might be somewhere else. So just maybe a couple of examples of how we use it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Stancel: <\/strong>[00:04:52] Yeah probably anybody who has been following the blockchain space could hear probably a thousand times like how all kinds of application and usage cases for blockchain and for smart contracts, since it&#8217;s basically a piece of software. So it can do pretty much anything you programming suits. So it can be used in multiple ways. But still it&#8217;s true even today that the most of the use cases, whether it&#8217;s for blockchain, but also for smart contracts, it&#8217;s in the financial space what we called\u00a0 DeFi decentralized\u00a0 finance. We&#8217;ll\u00a0 talking about probably next time. Most of the things happen currently today when it comes to smart contracts. So we have lots of basically applications, pieces of code that behave like financial institutions, even though they are not, they&#8217;re just really like a simple piece of code or set of smart contracts that are compost together and interact with each other. They perform functionalities such as exchanges, lending platforms or they allow us to create the synthetic derivatives on top of the blockchain networks and our insurance products and\u00a0 all kinds of things. Of course, apart from these financial use cases, there is lots of things going on in the area of logistics and healthcare industry as well. Basically these smart contracts could allow us to, of course automate lot of processes in all of these areas, but through is most of the attention is still being paid to the financial use cases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:06:21] And could one of the ones that send, for example, you mentioned\u00a0 shipping or in other areas, is that something like, could smart contracts be used in trade finance in that regard?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Stancel: <\/strong>[00:06:30] Yeah, definitely trade finance is definitely one of the areas where it&#8217;s been explored and being used. What it boils down to is always that traditionally, oftentimes it was the case in the corporate environment, enterprise environment, when it comes to blockchain, there was always this kind of dilemma of whether to use a permissionless open public blockchain networks or the so-called private blockchain networks that are set up only between some of the entities involved in those business processes or consortias.\u00a0 Typically this way, if you have more permissioned environment, the blockchain kind of a little bit is losing the edge compared to regular enterprise legacy solutions and databases. It can be done there, but because it usually has been deployed in this way and we couldn&#8217;t see so much network effect and adoption coming in there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:07:25] And I can appreciate the permissioned blockchains or almost like databases, to be honest, in some ways aren&#8217;t there. There&#8217;s always be confined it or safer. I think there was always also that discussion, whether it&#8217;s true or not about the amount of energy involved in mining and rogue miners and how they could have control and if you&#8217;re in financial services, then we don&#8217;t need that. We need some other form of control and that say permissioned blockchains or wannabes people in this space are having problems with some of the regulators and other areas as well. So it&#8217;s not been a smooth ride really for anybody. I think in that space, either. You mentioned Ethereum early on and again, in episode one, we talked about the actual Bitcoin cause it was, oh, you know, it&#8217;s all the rage as it were. So what is Ethereum and how is it different to Bitcoin?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Stancel: <\/strong>[00:08:14] Okay.\u00a0 Ethereum was created by probably now, already quite famous person, founder of Ethereum Vitalik Buterin, who was back then a young boy who was a journalist a Bitcoin magazine.\u00a0 He was a college dropout who started to work on Ethereum because he basically took the concept of Bitcoin and I was like, okay, we have a really cool decentralized network that we use for sending and receiving transactions and moving the store, like some value over the internet naturally, but we could extend this concept and enrich it with some other functionalities, not just to do kind of simple transactions, but basically we could try to upload any kind of programs and applications. He conceived the concept of this blockchain network that would have on top of it, the ritual of Turing complete virtual machine, which will be capable to compute anything at the big program, into it, given enough competition of power.\u00a0 That&#8217;s what he did. He wasn&#8217;t actually the first one to do so. There were some attempts before Ethereum was conceived, but they kind of failed. And Ethereum was probably, definitely the only one at that point around 2014, when it was introduced caught up and got lots of attention from the community. And lots of people started to work on it and then in 2015, the Ethereum network launched and allowed us to do this smart contract applications to create assets on top of Ethereum, which was not so easy to do on top of Bitcoin. Even though if we would probably talk to Bitcoin maximalists, they would argue that you can do all these things out on top of Bitcoin, but it&#8217;s more complicated. And for some reason it doesn&#8217;t happen there so much. At least in this era, this Ethereum stole the show for the Bitcoin and now us, that&#8217;s why a lot of people think that there is discussion about possible flipping, which means that Ethereum would flip Bitcoin in terms of the market cap value. Because it can actually capture the whole lot more value because there&#8217;s so much more activity on top of the Ethereum which is actually true. Many people don&#8217;t know that, but for the last few months, that&#8217;s has been the truth that Ethereum has been settling much larger volumes, transaction volumes, there has been much more going on\u00a0 on the network. Because it can be used for so many use cases. So, and it has also become infamously victim\u00a0 of its own success because the network is congested and they are very high fees currently on the network, which are being solved throu any other solutions. But this is how Ethereum is different to Bitcoin and of course now in 2021, we have also a lot of, a lot of competitors to Ethereum that are trying to enter the arena of smart contracts. And they&#8217;re coming up with different innovations and different design trade-offs for the smart contract networks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:11:15] You mentioned assets and uses or use cases in the Ethereum. So could you have a couple of examples of what assets might be created or what a couple of these use cases might be?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Stancel: <\/strong>[00:11:25] Probably people who have been following the blockchain space, they remember the term ICO and this ICO craze that we had, the 2017.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:11:35] It seems like a long time ago.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Stancel: <\/strong>[00:11:39] Yeah, definitely. We had lots of, lots of projects that are trying to integrate blockchain to their applications. And usually what it meant was that they can kind of create a token that had some artificially created the functionality and role. It was just like a concept of before we called it credits or something like that, it depends on the applications, but now they were not on the SQL database, but they were on a decentralized blockchain network and they were more liquid . People and users could trade with them and that&#8217;s exactly what fueled the hype around it. And we could wittness all very broad spectrum of assets being created there. And\u00a0 awesome when we look at today and all this defy space, we have these different decentralized, smart contract applications that are performing these financial activities. And because there are still some decisions that needs to be made from the perspective of the applications. So how do we do it? We have token holders. That have these token and have governance rise so they can vote on the changes onto protocols. And oftentimes these tokens come with different sets of rights or different sets of benefits. Sometimes they can even get some portion of the reward or of the profit generated by those protocols and so on.\u00a0 It can be\u00a0 different, but this is roughly\u00a0 that like\u00a0 what&#8217;s going on there. And we are now all these crypto assets that\u00a0 are in from technological point of view they are pretty similar because they are just so cold ERC 20 tokens ,\u00a0 but they have always different function in their own ecosystem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:13:25] It&#8217;s interesting, cause it seems like 2017 is almost, we would call it ancient history book. Do you remember the craze and the whole FOMO around it, that fear of missing out and closed,\u00a0 token within a closed environment or\u00a0 if you had a telco involved and a bunch of retailers and\u00a0 you could spend get tokens and spend them within that closed environment and then go out to market and raise money initially for marketing and then for more. And it almost seems like that came and it went. And we forgot about those. You said the ICO was all the rage, right. And then we, that we haven&#8217;t spoken about it anymore. Now we&#8217;re speaking more about the different, as you said, the Ethereum and the competitors. So is it becoming now a very competitive environment or they&#8217;re, you know, 5, 10, 20, a hundred competitors to Ethereum?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Stancel: <\/strong>[00:14:13] Ethereum historically has always had much more competitors than Bitcoin, because I think Bitcoin has a unique place in the cryptocurrency world that cannot be replicated so easily, but with Ethereum it&#8217;s not that easy or\u00a0 it&#8217;s more complicated. The reason is that also lots of smart contract platforms that are coming to the market. They are for example, oftentimes replicate the Ethereum virtual machine. So if that person wants to develop on these new platforms, they can still use the same smart contract, the same language solidity, and that is used on Ethereum so it&#8217;s kind of easy for them to transfer. Of course, these new networks, there are quite many of them. I think today we can say that they are at least reasonable, like 10 reasonable competitors when it comes to the smart contract platforms.\u00a0 All of them. Let&#8217;s say this 10 or 15, maybe even they come with different technologies. Some of them are pretty innovative. They do offer different trade-offs. They are typically more scalable than Ethereum but again, at some costs and that&#8217;s a more nuanced and deeper debate that we probably not going to have today, but there&#8217;s definitely a lot of competitors, especially this last year. We could see probably at least sounded like a seven, eight major smart contract platform being launched.\u00a0 It&#8217;s still, we can say it&#8217;s in the beginning like all this platform just are now trying to bootstrap some communities and the show off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:15:52] And is that this is maybe a naive question for someone, as I said, who&#8217;s more lay person in this space. Is there an interoperability between these different competitors? And actually what&#8217;s the interoperability when it comes to FIA for example, with crypto as well. Does that exist?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Stancel: <\/strong>[00:16:10] I mean, so the intro interoperable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:16:16] Funny word, isn&#8217;t it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Stancel: <\/strong>[00:16:18] Yeah. That&#8217;s tough one. So this phenomenon is usually provided by exchanges or brokerage companies typically. So that&#8217;s how we usually people transfer their fee and money into the smart contract platforms and the interoperability between the smart contract platforms themselves it&#8217;s a little bit more trickier. There&#8217;s no simple answer to that, but we do have definitely multiple ways how different smart contract platforms can communicate between each other. Oftentimes there are some ways that are more centralized and we have to kind of more rely on the third parties that we need to trust. And also, especially recently in the past few months, we could see on the markets and some of the\u00a0 first solutions that are trying to completely mitigate these need to trust the third party in this way. So some so-called bridges that connect these platforms and that provide sort of trustless way how to transfer assets between those platforms. So, but it&#8217;s still, again, very early for the space. It&#8217;s very likely that I think in a matter of two years, let&#8217;s say all this measure platforms will be interconnected. Or this one, because we can say that usually Ethereum is connected probably to every single major competitor. But all of those other networks are not connected between themselves. So Ethereum was definitely\u00a0 I would say trading venue of the new internet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:17:55] It&#8217;s really fascinating, actually. And as you were talking, I was also thinking about everything that&#8217;s happened over like the last year and a half. And every time we talk about a cryptocurrency, we think about people that are outside the mainstream system. I mean, now we&#8217;re splitting it. We&#8217;re talking about central bank, digital currencies, as well as sitting alongside FIA .But also I sometimes think, industries run away with what the customer or the consumer wants. Are these solutions really beneficial to the consumer and the end user and possibly let&#8217;s do a little bit closer down on the unbanked or the under-banked people outside of the mainstream system, or is that just something that the industry is, we just talk about those marketing hype?.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Stancel: <\/strong>[00:18:34] All of these things\u00a0 we&#8217;re created in a way in there designed in a way so they are completely permissionless and accessible, ideally to everybody on the planet who has connections with the internet. But especially recently as the network got really popular and it got congested, the feasts Chiraq that it basically\u00a0 eliminated All the regular mainstream retail users. And it has been the main trading venue for the speculators, market makers and very people who trade a lot. But I think looking forward the outlook is that definitely this, all this Netflix will be much, much more easier to use for regular people. I think kind of by accident what Ethereum happened to achieve is that I think they&#8217;re kind of almost solved this one of the kind of questions are on the open internet, the single sign on because\u00a0 now, if you have extensions to your browser, such as Metta mask, which is probably one of the most used and most popular pieces of infrastructure when it comes to the Ethereum and the smart contract world, you can basically log in with this through mathematic , through\u00a0 your Ethereum account to multiple services. They don&#8217;t need to even know your other identity because they just know your address and, since we are on the blockchain, all your past actions are being locked and recorded and are there out to be seen by everyone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:20:08] Everyone on the blockchain. This raises a really important points about the anonymity, but also having enough information about somebody we&#8217;re talking about that clearly in terms of digital identity after what happened around the world and in terms of COVID. You don&#8217;t need to know everything about me for me to walk into a bar and buy a drink, with my, Token or anything else that I&#8217;m using. You just need to know that I have the right. I have the permission to be able to do that. You don&#8217;t need to know my medical history, my address, my telephone number, my age, my, you know, all the other things about me. As long as the token says that I&#8217;m, I am where I&#8217;m supposed to be, or I&#8217;m allowed to be. And I think this opens up the discussion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Stancel: <\/strong>[00:20:49] Yeah. I think if you were showing me your Ethereum address I can say what kind of person you are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:20:57] Somebody who&#8217;s, well, probably more technically adept than I am. I have no Ethereum on that dress, right. I&#8217;m heavily into the trading. I mean, for me, this is fascinating. I was two weeks ago? I can&#8217;t remember one and a half ago I was on a panel and Vitalik the was the keynote that kicked off the panel in the middle east. So I think we also, the rest of the other parts of the world now are starting to look at this also as Africa, I mean the whole middle asian region middle east and north Africa is now taking notice. Whereas before it might&#8217;ve been something that we just looked at in our own little bubble, which is why I think also my head, I was thinking, you know, how does this help with parts of the world where we have a lot of remittance happening, or we have a lot of people that are coming in and working from abroad .Where we have a lot of people who are un-banked and under-banked, but have access to smartphones. Where we&#8217;re not, you know, some have very deep internet penetration, others don&#8217;t. And so they&#8217;re just onnot smart phones with dumb phones or the phones that aren&#8217;t accessing.\u00a0 But it&#8217;s definitely something that&#8217;s capturing, people&#8217;s imagination more on a global basis. I have no doubt that we&#8217;ll be revisiting the subject. I know we&#8217;re coming up, actually, everybody on episode three of this series. We are going to look at decentralized finance and NFTs. Oh, I could talk for years about NFTs and whether or not they&#8217;re actually going to stick around or not, or is it just a fad? So, David, I feel more knowledgeable now than I did when we started, which is great. And I felt the same way we&#8217;ve finished the Bitcoin session. So I thank you for that. And I would say to everybody, if you&#8217;re subscribing or you&#8217;re joining us for the first time, go back and listen to the first episode and stay with us for the third episode. As I said, where we get to DeFi and NFTs. Thank you very much for being with us on Banking on air and everyone please for all the usual channels to subscribe and join us again. Thoroughly enjoyable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Stancel: <\/strong>[00:22:53] Thanks for having me.

project to a secure crypto wallet with 170k+ downloads! When Vacuumlabs developers created a web version of a crypto wallet for the Ada cryptocurrency \u2014 the currency associated to Cardano \u2014\u00a0in their free time, they had no idea about the success it would bring. After engineers from EMURGO discovered this wallet being created without any documentation, the collaboration between EMURGO and Vacuumlabs was started. Almost 3 years later, our podcast host, Marcel Klimo, had the pleasure to talk with Vicente Almonacid, one of the Yoroi wallet app engineers. Of course, they didn\u2019t talk only about the success of the collaboration, but also about tech specifics of blockchain, its growth in the first months of 2021, and EMURGO\u2019s future plans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The beginning of Vicente\u2019s career in EMURGO was immediately tied to Vacuumlabs: without any previous experience with similar jobs, Vicente learned how to design crypto wallets by studying the code written by Vacuumlabs engineers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>\u201cAs I was reviewing the code and getting familiar with it, I soon understood why EMURGO decided to work with you guys. I thought, yeah, these people know what they are doing. So when I took the lead of Yoroi mobile, I was already starting from a very good foundation, thanks to especially the collaboration that we had with Vacuumlabs.\u201d<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Building something on the blockchain is different work than building any other app, since it doesn\u2019t use a traditional backend system, and it doesn\u2019t have a regular database for storing information. You need to look at it differently, considering it\u2019s a distributed system in a network.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>\u201cOne of the tricky things about it is that you need to think about, for instance, concurrent processes that are happening in the blockchain.\u201d<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Vicente believes that there has been a significant increase in an overall validation of cryptocurrencies and the ability to apply them not only in financial applications but also in many other aspects and industries.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>\u201cWhen you look into the projects that actually provide real innovation in the space, all these projects have a clear vision for both the future of their project, but also have a secure and decentralized network. In my opinion, this is the most important thing when we&#8217;re talking about public blockchains.\u201d<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As Vicente highlights, being open source is a critical point here, as it brings full transparency. And our partnership brought a lot into the industry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>\u201cSo here, I think that EMURGO and Vacuumlabs are a critical part of the infrastructure. Actually, we build the infrastructure that helps onboarding new users to set up a wallet very easily and quickly. We need companies with professionalism that Vacuumlabs and EMURGO provide in this area. We are open source and you can see exactly who was the developer that did this bit or that bit of the code.\u201d<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>And what is the future according to Vicente?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>\u201cI&#8217;m very different compared to the average developer crypto enthusiasts in the sense that I would like to see blockchain technology help to fight problems like climate change. I think that the problem with climate change in general is a coordination problem, and blockchains help to solve coordination problems. So for me, it seems kind of natural that we&#8217;ll end up using this kind of technology to help.\u201d<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course, that\u2019s not all there is to it.

Today, I&#8217;m really excited to have one of the software engineers. It&#8217;s a Emurgo on the call with me today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vicente Almonacid: <\/strong>[00:00:24] Thanks for having me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p> <strong><strong>Marcel Klimo<\/strong>: <\/strong>[00:00:26] Great. So before we start on, before we kick in all to all of the difficult questions, can you give me a bit of a background into how you ended up at Emurgo and where you come from?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vicente Almonacid: <\/strong>[00:00:37] Well, my name is Vicente. I&#8217;m originally from Chile, but living in France right now for several years now. So I&#8217;m a software engineer with Emurgo. Working on the Cardano R&amp;D team. I started working on crypto back in early 2017, but that time I was actually hoping to become a satellite communications engineer, but I&#8217;ll say\u00a0 I was\u00a0 finishing my PhD thesis. I was feeling very curious about crypto. Since then I&#8217;ve just been working on a full time on this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><strong>Marcel Klimo<\/strong>: <\/strong>[00:01:09] Perfect! Software engineer from a satellite engineer. So that&#8217;s a big shift right into crypto. I guess it&#8217;s still programming, right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vicente Almonacid: <\/strong>[00:01:18] There is still programming, but different kinds of programming, a lot of MATLAB low-level programming as well that, you know, C stuff like that, but not much in common with protocols.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><strong>Marcel Klimo<\/strong>: <\/strong>[00:01:29] Yeah, absolutely. I mean this whole world of crypto with real value being held in cryptocurrencies,\u00a0 it&#8217;s really the future and working on\u00a0 real satellites now to the virtual world it&#8217;s an interesting shift. So let me just jump to the question, which is probably on a lot of people&#8217;s minds and very pertinent. You work at Emurgo. So for those who haven&#8217;t ever heard of Emurgo for whatever reason,\u00a0 how does it fit into the entire blockchain ecosystem? How would you introduce it to somebody who hasn&#8217;t ever heard of Emurgo and what you do there?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vicente Almonacid: <\/strong>[00:02:02] Okay. So Emurgo is part of three main companies that are behind the Cardano blockchain since the beginning, since the Genesis. The others being the Cardano foundation IOG previously called IOSK or Input Output.. So we are generally known as the commercial arm of Cardano. We are focused mainly on increasing the overall value of the Cardano ecosystem. We have a business branch that is more oriented to enterprise solutions, mainly in the supply chain sector and another branch, which is more focused on development of products in the Cardano block chain itself. And that&#8217;s the unit I work on specifically. One of the projects that we develop here in Emurgo in the Cardano branch is Yoroi wallet. It is a light wallet in the sense that it does not require users to download the whole blockchain and synchronize with it. So this way we can develop Yoroi a multi-platform application that can be easily maintained in browser for instance, as an ETA application in iOS and Android. Also, we have another branch, which is about training is called Emurgo Academy. And it&#8217;s been working on India for a couple of years now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><strong>Marcel Klimo<\/strong>: <\/strong>[00:03:19] So if I recall correctly, our journeys is the Vacuumlabs and Emurgo really kicked off and became official with this app, right? People can read about it a little bit more, but can you tell me a bit more about how Yoroi got started, your role in it and how it has changed over time as we were developing it together?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vicente Almonacid: <\/strong>[00:03:37] As you know, Yoroi\u00a0 was one of the earliest collaborations between Emurgo and Vacuumlabs. But for me it has some sort of special meaning because by the time I joined, I didn&#8217;t have much experience regarding wallet design, all the intricacies that are behind it. I joined I think a couple of months after the first major version Yoroi was released. So I learned a lot actually by reading code that was writen by engineers from Vacuumlabs basically. And as I was reviewing the code\u00a0 and\u00a0 being familiar with it and adding more features, improving some details, I soon understood why Emurgo decided to work with you guys. I thought, yeah, these people know what they are doing. You quickly realize that building a wallet is not something that can be done by a random team of developers, especially in the early days of Cardano and considering all the constraints that you have in a distributed system like blockchain, you need experienced skilled people with a deep understanding of the complete stack of technologies involved, but also we are experiencing\u00a0 security things that have to do\u00a0 with everything you have in financial obligations in general. So when I took the lead of Yoroi mobile, I was already starting on a very good foundations, thanks to especially the collaboration that we had with Vacuumlabs. From then, we have being in constant communication with engineers from Vacuumlabs especially to discuss a new features that come into the protocol that may impact our wallet services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><strong>Marcel Klimo<\/strong>: <\/strong>[00:05:12] Okay. So to reveal a bit of the sort of secret thoughts that went into creating the Yoroi wallet, what would you say were some very specific design patterns or approaches that you chose that others can learn from, for another blockchain or in general, in different financial services in the future? What are things that sort of surprised you that you really learned a lot about.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vicente Almonacid: <\/strong>[00:05:35] Yeah. The first thing that you need to know when you&#8217;re building something on of the blockchain is that you don&#8217;t have a traditional backend system. You need a way to interact with the blockchain, of course, which requires a backend, but you don&#8217;t have like a regular database where you can store user information for instance, or there are a lot of things that traditional applications can handle through our backend. We don&#8217;t have that. We only have the blockchain and the information that is publicly available in the blockchain. One of the tricky things about it is that you need to think about, for instance, concurrent processes that are happening in the blockchain. You may, for instance, want to send a transaction through the wallet, but at the same time, you can have like a transaction incoming to your wallet, which will change your balance on the state of your account. You have to think about many things that are happening in parallel. Well, because it&#8217;s a distributed system in network.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><strong>Marcel Klimo<\/strong>: <\/strong>[00:06:37] Those are very good points because right now, speaking of all these distributed systems, it feels to me like we&#8217;re now finally moving into that era of everything being in the cloud, on the internet and everything just connected in through some sort of lights clients. And it really doesn&#8217;t matter where the servers are and how the data is held, it&#8217;s now all in the blockchain. Would you say that blockchain applications are building this very light internet, heavy cloud heavy future? Or is this just one of the patterns that you&#8217;re seeing?\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vicente Almonacid: <\/strong>[00:07:10] I think there are different approaches to this, for instance, in the Cardano where we have another wallet, which is called Daedalus. Daedalus actually downloads the full blockchain into your computer. That is a different approach in the sense that you make sure that all the transactions that actually being processed inside your computer and have different security properties as well. But I think that there&#8217;s a space for different kind of solutions. Users will have different requirements. Some people will want to have a full node operating their computers while other people would prefer to have a light wallet on their phones because they only have a phone for instance. So it&#8217;s super important to cover all the different spaces in terms of requirements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><strong>Marcel Klimo<\/strong>: <\/strong>[00:07:56] So it was exactly like when we speak with our clients and they tell us, they ask us, is this the right approach? And we say, yes, It depends on the case.\u00a0 This is the current situation, even with the way you approach designing blockchain applications.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vicente Almonacid: <\/strong>[00:08:11] Yeah. But there&#8217;s not a single approach or it&#8217;s not like we are converting it into a single view of things in Daedalus in the things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><strong>Marcel Klimo<\/strong>: <\/strong>[00:08:20] Great. So moving beyond Yoroi, are you also involved in other projects in Emurgo that you Vacuumlabs has either been involved with or that you&#8217;re really passionate about?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vicente Almonacid: <\/strong>[00:08:29] Well, in terms of our collaboration with Vacuumlabs they actually typically work on maintaining code related to hardware wallets. Hardware wallets are something that we support in normal, our Yoroi products for people who don&#8217;t know about hardware wallets these are perhaps the more advanced and secure way to store and manage your digital assets. They are very easy to set up. You can use them with both the Yoroi extension and Yoroi mobile. This is part of the critical infrastructure that is developed by a Vacuumlabs.\u00a0 We are constantly communicating with people from Vacuumlabs you know, to coordinate new updates to this code basis. Me in particular, I&#8217;m not involved in other projects apart from Yoroi , but I also, I&#8217;m very active also in the community watching what are the new initiatives that are starting to pop up and try to give a hand to developers that are jumping in right now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><strong>Marcel Klimo<\/strong>: <\/strong>[00:09:29] Absolutely. So let me give you a difficult question this time. Well, maybe difficult. So what&#8217;s the actual state of the software infrastructure today? Is there something that&#8217;s really limiting you or is it just really about taking the time to build it? Is there something that&#8217;s really coming up in the future that you wouldn&#8217;t mind sharing with me today?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vicente Almonacid: <\/strong>[00:09:47] Of course. We can actually observe right now is that is getting more and more major that it&#8217;s evolving faster and faster. One year ago, for instance, we were just the Shelley protocol and it&#8217;s improved a proof of stake consensus algorithm. Only in our testing network in a testing environment. Right now we have Shelley totally integrated in main net, as well as support for native assets onto metadata and a new variety of projects that are popping up under the beam founded by catalyst. For people who don&#8217;t know about catalyst, it&#8217;s actually a platform in which anybody can submit a proposal for, could be an application and new standard, or it could be a Dow lot of things. Anybody that actually is a Yoroi user or a user of other Cardano wallets can bolt on these proposals. Thanks to that things have been evolving very fast in the last weeks or months, just a month ago, people were barely figuring out how to play with native assets. But right now there are multiple community tools for minting new assets for minting NFTs based onto metadata. These NFTs are already being traded, somehow paying the community and acquired in value as we speak actually.\u00a0 But the main block right now is that we don&#8217;t have support for smart contracts. As you may know, that means that we can have, for instance, like a decentralized exchange or many of the decentralized finance primitives that we have in blockchains, like Ethereum, for instance, you know, decentralized lending and borrowing decentralized margin trading and stuff like that. But the good thing is that we know how it will work. We have many playgrounds testing environments to test how the smart contracts will actually work on Cardano. We also have a date for the next hard work, which will bring smart contracts into Cardano. It&#8217;s going to be in August this year. Also, you can see that there are more and more developers jumping in and starting to design the apps, proposing the apps in catalyst. So I really hope that by the time we have Alonso released, the ecosystem will be quite ready with many applications ready to be launched.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo: <\/strong>[00:12:18] Yeah.I know feeling. Anytime there&#8217;s a date attached to something that&#8217;s like that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s when you really get excited about the things. That&#8217;s really, when you start dreading as that release date comes closer and closer, and you&#8217;re really trying, having to make all the right decisions and put other things on the roadmap for the future. Can you reveal something that&#8217;s on the road not coming up soon?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vicente Almonacid: <\/strong>[00:12:40] Yes. Well about Emurgo, one of the main things we&#8217;ve been pushing for is a DAP connector. We released the ERGO DAP connector. So for people who haven&#8217;t heard about ERGO, ERGO is another blockchain, but it actually shares many traits with Cardano. For instance, it&#8217;s also based on extended UT Excel model. And it also has a similar approach for smart contracts. So basically they also use like a functional approach for coding smart contracts. And the idea behind this collaboration with ERGO was that we could start to test this kind of features that we will have eventually in Cardano before in an environment that has so many similarities with Cardano. In the roadmap the idea is to have this same functionality, actually for Cardano. As you may know, we have many users as you also have in Adalite we&#8217;ve been increasing dramatically in the last few months. So it&#8217;s natural for the users to expect that the current wallets will provide a way to interact with smart contracts once they&#8217;re out there. So that&#8217;s the main thing we are working on right now. There&#8217;s also collaboration for a building, a stable coin. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve heard about that called H U S D. It&#8217;s a protocol-based stable coin in the sense that we don&#8217;t need to back it up with actual dollars, but there&#8217;s instead protocol mechanism that is riding on smart contracts to keep the bag with respect to the dollar,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo: <\/strong>[00:14:16] To the dollar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vicente Almonacid: <\/strong>[00:14:17] Yeah. So this product involved a lot of research regarding Oracle pools. Because we need to have some information about what&#8217;s happening outside the blockchain. And for that, we need some very robust system that can not be tricked. And also we&#8217;ve been researching about sterilization mechanisms. And the thing is that in the context of Cardano it&#8217;s a take soul-based blockchain so much of the things that have been already tested on Ethereum, for instance, won&#8217;t work here. So we need to come up with your stuff basically.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><strong>Marcel Klimo<\/strong>: <\/strong>[00:14:50] So it&#8217;s really laying the ground for the future. You&#8217;re establishing the railroads for years and years to come with the extreme growth that we&#8217;ve seen. You can technically look at any cryptocurrency, but even just looking at ADA. If you held ADA in December compared to now, especially larger amounts you&#8217;re probably a very happy man. Or significantly happier than you were in December. With COVID and everything is it just the whole COVID output of the sort of potential depression and things that we&#8217;re seeing in the real world markets, which are still behaving very confusing in any days. What do you think is driving all of this sort of explosive growth?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vicente Almonacid: <\/strong>[00:15:28] Yeah, that&#8217;s a very good and tough question because\u00a0 you can view it in many different ways.\u00a0 Apart from the fact that many people are currently seeing cryptocurrencies are as hit for their portfolios in general. I also think that there&#8217;s been some sort of overall validation about what cryptocurrencies can achieve in general, not only for financial applications, but also in many aspects of society, many industrial applications. Apart from that, I think that there&#8217;s this validation. There&#8217;s a lot more capital coming into cryptocurrencies in general, not only into Cardano but once we had this Interest from traditional investors in general, they start to look into other alternatives. I think that the natural way of reasoning here is to start to take a look into what are those projects that actually provide real innovation in the space. What are those projects that are actually backed by highly professional companies. All those projects that have like a clear vision for the future projects that have a secure and decentralized network, which is in my opinion, like the most important things, when we&#8217;re talking about public blockchains. Also the community and so on. So I guess that after the Shelley hard work and last year we started to see interest in Cardano growing faster and faster. So here, I think that Emurgo and Vacuumlabs have been playing an important role. Actually, we build the infrastructure that helps onboarding new users to set up a wallet like very easily and quick. Those are in my opinion, critical part of the infrastructure. And that&#8217;s why we need companies with professionalism that Vacuumlabs and Emurgo provide in this area.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo: <\/strong>[00:17:23] So is there something that makes us different from the rest of the FinTech industry?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:27] <strong>Vicente Almonacid: <\/strong>[00:17:27] Interesting question in my opinion. When you think about it, for instance, if you download an app for your bank, you trust the application because you trust your bank, but you have no clue about who actually wrote&nbsp; code.&nbsp; You just trust that your bank, the good decisions. And in crypto to this is totally different because in order for all the decentralization narrative, to make sense, you need the code to be open source in general. So all the main applications like the note,the wallets, et cetera, are in general open source. Ergo, most of what we, Emurgo&nbsp; and Vacuumlabs do is open source and you can see exactly who was the developer that did this bit or that bit of the code. And it&#8217;s a completely different process, I guess, regarding more traditional companies in the financial sector.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><strong>Marcel Klimo<\/strong>: <\/strong>[00:18:17] You can always run, get the blame on somebody, right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vicente Almonacid: <\/strong>[00:18:21] Yeah. We are a bit exposed, I guess.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><strong>Marcel Klimo<\/strong>: <\/strong>[00:18:23] Yeah but I guess you can also look at who did the pull request check and blame them as well, if you want. But, you know, it was really not a blaming game right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vicente Almonacid: <\/strong>[00:18:32] Yeah. But at the same time, you can also start, like knowing who are actually the people behind it. And it&#8217;s not only about the name of the company, but it&#8217;s also about, the individuals that are part of these companies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><strong>Marcel Klimo<\/strong>: <\/strong>[00:18:46] Absolutely. So this is much more and I would say much more transparent when you&#8217;re building out infrastructure in this open way, because the trust is really important there. You can see the community who is building that software and it isn&#8217;t just a piece of code built by some institution somewhere, it&#8217;s actually something that is much more open and makes the financial services of the future much more open. And at the same time, anonymized. Which really is a bit of a paradox. But it is quite unique. Even if you look at the world through the spectrum perspective of say the editors of Wikipedia, the fact that there were contributors that really created the biggest and most interesting broad encyclopedia in the world. Whereas you had before that you had, encyclopedia Britannica, which had I guess, hundreds of employees and now it&#8217;s crowdsourced in this open fashion, which is fairly unique in the history of the world. I&#8217;m really just excited about where all of the sort of commercial interests and open interests of the world lie. As we get into the crypto world and the blockchain world, we start talking about the NFTs, which are really cool right now and everybody&#8217;s talking about them. And they&#8217;ll\u00a0 find their place in the economy and, the world at large. So I think it&#8217;s just in general, it&#8217;s all converging towards something that will eventually be much more open and outward very cool, because that your daily job as you&#8217;re doing this it&#8217;s constantly evolving as you discover new ways of working with these completely new technologies that didn&#8217;t exist just a few years ago. So is there something that really interests you right now? Something that&#8217;s really keeping you excited\u00a0 and that you would like to share with us here?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vicente Almonacid: <\/strong>[00:20:42] Yeah. Good question. Because there are many things that are interesting in this space, but personally and I think that here I&#8217;m very different compared to the average developer crypto enthusiasts in the sense that I will like to see blockchain, helping to fight problems like climate change actually. But the problem is that we are also part of the Poland,\u00a0 especially with proof of work chains. That&#8217;s not the case for Cardano.\u00a0 That&#8217;s good news at least, but I think that the problem with climate change in general is a coordination problem.\u00a0 Blockchains help to solve coordination problems. So for me, it&#8217;s, it seems kind of natural that we&#8217;ll end up using this kind of technologies to help. Now, for instance, I don&#8217;t know, in improving the efficiency of carbon markets, stuff like that. But I think that we are still early stage.\u00a0 Anyway, I think this is going to come in the future. Regarding more fun stuff like DeFI, nFTs and so on, I&#8217;m actually of course, super bullish in everything that is about providing financial services to those who don&#8217;t have access to basic stuff like lending, borrowing, the minimum stuff that you need to be a business in general is something critical to develop in poor countries. And I think that Cardano is heading in that direction, which is one of the things I like about it.\u00a0 Probably it&#8217;s going to be one of the things I will like to work on in the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><strong>Marcel Klimo<\/strong>: <\/strong>[00:22:28] Finish us off and I know you&#8217;re a very, very busy man. Let me give you a very simple question. If you hadn&#8217;t called back to your hometown and put up a billboard, what would you put on it? What would you want to say to the world that you&#8217;ve learned and that you want others to know about? What would you like to teach through a single billboard?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vicente Almonacid: <\/strong>[00:22:48] There are two things that come to my mind. The first one is that you eventually learned that you don&#8217;t need to be like the smartest guy to build meaningful things in life. It could be code or it could be, I don&#8217;t know, a service, a company that you could work in the public sector, whatever, but it&#8217;s mostly about hard work. I don&#8217;t know how I would put that in a phrase, but yeah, I could probably try to figure it out something about that. A few days ago, I was just listening to some video about Steve Jobs talking about something similar and he said like something about the moment you realize that the world is built by people who is no smarter than you, then everything changes. So something that that could be a good phrase for a billboard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo: <\/strong>[00:23:36] Don&#8217;t be the smartest. You don&#8217;t need to be the smartest guy in the room. You just need to put in the hard work and actually confront problems in a meaningful way. I love it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vicente Almonacid: <\/strong>[00:23:47] Yeah. It&#8217;s about that and believe in yourself.\u00a0 Realizing that people are no better than you because you know, they come from richer countries or richer families.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo: <\/strong>[00:24:00] It is a very positive message and I thank you for it today. Thank you for coming on the podcast. And if people want to find out more or about you and what you do, where can they find you?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vicente Almonacid: <\/strong>[00:24:09] For me, I&#8217;m active in Twitter is V underscore&#8230; almana seed is going to be a, probably difficult to spell that out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo: <\/strong>[00:24:18] Don&#8217;t worry everyone. If you&#8217;re listening to this, we&#8217;re going to put this into description and going to see it there. You\u00a0 can go straight to the Twitter profile.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vicente Almonacid: <\/strong>[00:24:25] Yeah, you&#8217;ll find me on Twitter.\u00a0 There&#8217;s also the Emurgo website Emurgo.io.

Is there something I should&#8217;ve asked and didn&#8217;t ask.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vicente Almonacid: <\/strong>[00:24:52] Yeah, I think that&#8217;s all. It&#8217;s been a pleasure. Thanks for having me.\u00a0 Let&#8217;s give this collaboration together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo: <\/strong>[00:24:59] Absolutely.

Strike&#8217;s remittance trial in El Salvador paves the way for the future of remittance payments, effectively driving the cost of sending cross-border payments to zero.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Bitcoin the network and bitcoin the asset<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin is usually perceived as the thing that goes up (or down) in price that people hold, speculate on, buy or sell. That&#8217;s bitcoin the asset &#8211; usually spelled with a lower case &#8220;b&#8221;. Bitcoin the asset is the most exciting aspect for most people, and its short-term volatility and long-term upwards trend is the gateway drug to the crypto space.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But besides bitcoin the asset, we have Bitcoin the network &#8211; conventionally spelled with an upper case &#8220;B &#8220;. Bitcoin the network is often neglected and taken for granted as a simple enabler of bitcoin the asset. But Bitcoin, the network, has many exciting features on its own. Let&#8217;s take a look:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>it is a global settlement network and knows no borders<\/li><li>there is no credit and no delayed settlement, as transactions are either unconfirmed or fully settled<\/li><li>it doesn&#8217;t require any identification of its participants (miners, account holders, transaction parties)<\/li><li>it is fully open-source and permissionless<\/li><li>it has no single point of failure and doesn&#8217;t fall under any single jurisdiction<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These are major differences to any existing payment or settlement networks like Visa, PayPal, Swift, Fedwire, etc. Bitcoin as an open, permissionless, global network is positioned to ultimately dominate, as such networks do when competing with permission-walled gardens. It&#8217;s a similar story to how Linux ultimately won as a dominating operating system for mission-critical services (most servers today are<a href=\"https:\/\/w3techs.com\/technologies\/comparison\/os-linux,os-windows\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> running<\/a> on a Linux environment).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the settlement network by itself isn&#8217;t enough. As many know, transactions over the Bitcoin network can be slow and costly, especially in times of high transaction demand. That&#8217;s why a payment layer called the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.coincenter.org\/education\/key-concepts\/lightning-network\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> Lightning Network<\/a> is being actively developed on top of Bitcoin. Lightning Network allows users to send bitcoin instantly and with almost zero cost. A $10 payment within Lightning Network arrives within a second, all over the world, and costs three satoshis (1 satoshi is 1\/100,000,000 bitcoin), i.e., the cost is $0.0015 or 0.015%. And the good news is the transaction fees aren&#8217;t much higher in relative terms with higher volumes. For further explanation of the Lightning Network fee mechanics, see<a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/suredbits\/lightning-101-lightning-network-fees-86abbbc17024\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> this blog post<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Strike<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Strike is a mobile application that cleverly combines the current financial system with Bitcoin&#8217;s Lightning Network capabilities. Strike&#8217;s founder Jack Mallers initially founded a Lightning-only wallet back in 2017. But he soon discovered the obstacle for the users to utilize Lightning transactions&#8217; tremendous potential fully: users have to use bitcoin the asset. Using bitcoin the asset for daily transactions is a problem for two reasons: the first one is bitcoin&#8217;s store of value capability is currently valued highly, and bitcoiners choose to hold bitcoin rather than transact with it. The second reason is the tax consequence: every bitcoin transaction is a taxable event.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mallers&#8217; solution to overcome both obstacles was to leverage Lightning Network capabilities without exposing users to bitcoin the asset (unless they choose to). So in the fall of 2019, Mallers came up with the idea that became Strike. The most fitting description of Strike is that it&#8217;s a <em>Bitcoin-native neo-bank <\/em>that allows users to send money instantly all around the world, with almost no cost. How is that possible?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the hood, Strike works as follows:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1) User connects his conventional bank account to the Strike app<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2) User initiates a transaction of $10 from the US to Europe, where the recipient would like to receive \u20ac8.2<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3) Strike debits the $10 from the sender&#8217;s bank account<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4) Strike converts the $10 to bitcoin on the Lightning Network<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5) Strike sends the bitcoin instantly via Lightning Network to its European branch (or partner institution)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6) Strike converts the bitcoin to \u20ac8.2<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>7) Recipient&#8217;s account on Strike is debited \u20ac8.2<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the given example, neither the sender nor the recipient came into contact with bitcoin the asset. Still, they were utilizing Bitcoin the network (or rather the Lightning Network built on top of Bitcoin). There is no taxable event.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The interesting part is how the USD gets converted to EUR. There is no Forex market involved. Instead, USD is first converted to bitcoin, and bitcoin is then converted to EUR. Since bitcoin has large liquidity in USD\/BTC and EUR\/BTC pairs, the resulting rate doesn&#8217;t deviate from the Forex rate. Bitcoin markets operate 24\/7\/365, and bitcoin has sufficient liquidity across dozens of currency pairs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>We now have an open monetary network that can physically settle any amount of value, at any time, to any place, at virtually no cost. Combine that with an application that allows you to utilize this open monetary network with your bank account, and you get monumental innovation and pure disruption.<\/em><\/p><p>-Jack Mallers,<a href=\"https:\/\/jimmymow.medium.com\/announcing-strike-global-2392b908f611\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> Announcing Strike Global<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Disrupting the remittance market: El Salvador case study<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Strike was publicly launched at the beginning of 2020 and was initially available only to US users. The primary use case in the US was the ability to pay Lightning Network invoices with dollars and vice versa. This fiat-bitcoin payments interoperability proved that Mallers&#8217; vision is workable. So at the beginning of 2021, Mallers announced the intention to go fully global by the end of 2021. And as a surprise to some observers, Mallers chose to focus on developing markets and started to provide remittance services in El Salvador.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>El Salvador is a small country in Central America, officially dollarized since 2001 and heavily dependent on remittances, mainly from the US. Around 22% of El Salvador&#8217;s GDP comes from remittance payments. But as Mallers points out in a recent<a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/aY5M-er2ybU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> podcast<\/a>, a large part of those remittance payments gets siphoned off by financial institutions due to an unfortunate combination of the small size of a typical payment and a fixed cost of a cross-border transaction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Strike has been active in El Salvador since the beginning of April and reached <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JackMallers\/status\/1386432966843244545\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">#1 in installed apps within three weeks<\/a>. It seems reasonable to predict that Strike will significantly disrupt the way locals receive money from their relatives abroad. Compared to conventional remittance providers, Strike is instant, doesn&#8217;t cut on the payment, has no limits on minimum sent amount, and is mobile-native.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the banking infrastructure in El Salvador isn&#8217;t as reliable as in the US, Strike allows recipients to hold USD stable coins in the app. The most popular one is currently USD Tether. There is already a well-functioning cryptocurrency community in El Salvador (one of the fast-growing local initiatives is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/strike-launches-bitcoin-lightning-payment-app-in-el-salvador-full-eu-support-is-next\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bitcoin Beach<\/a>). There are many ATMs, merchants, P2P traders, and bitcoin meetups where Tethers can be exchanged for physical dollars or spent directly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s next for Strike after El Salvador? Strike has active beta testers in the Philippines, one of the largest remittance markets in the world. And there are many more countries to come &#8211; the best advantage of Strike is that it doesn&#8217;t have to build its infrastructure. Bitcoin and Lightning Network infrastructure is developing rapidly, and so are the markets for bitcoin the asset. So all that is necessary for expansion is a local marketing campaign and perhaps a partnership with a local banking provider &#8211; but even that may be unnecessary, as we can see in El Salvador, where the US dollar is substituted with a stable coin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>Today Strike launched in El Salvador. However, the real victory is Strike launching in an emerging market and providing financial tools to people that have lacked them for centuries.

For now, Strike is a traditional VC-backed (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/lightning-startup-zap-raised-3-5m-for-bitcoin-app-ahead-of-visa-deal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$3.5m raise<\/a>) startup focused on rapid user growth. According to Mallers, Strike&#8217;s business model will leverage the large capacity of its Lightning payment channel. Institutional investors can leverage these channels to make lightning-fast arbitrage trades &#8211; something that isn&#8217;t possible today without depositing a lot of capital on multiple exchanges. Another possibility that Mallers mentioned previously is the payment for order flow, an approach similar to how<a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/articles\/active-trading\/020515\/how-robinhood-makes-money.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> Robinhood<\/a> makes money on its free brokerage service. Perhaps merchants will serve as a revenue stream through acquiring, as Strike&#8217;s costs are orders of magnitudes lower than card companies&#8217; due to eliminating chargeback risks.<a href=\"https:\/\/jimmymow.medium.com\/announcing-cashback-by-strike-cce2829bc152\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> Strike&#8217;s cashback<\/a> trial may also develop into a viable business model.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether Strike finds a successful business model or not, it already served as a proof of concept: services merging fintech and Lightning Network are possible and very popular when introduced to communities where they make an enormous impact due to substantial cost savings. Similar projects are already emerging (<a href=\"https:\/\/lastbit.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Lastbit<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will be exciting to watch Strike and similar startups come head to head with conventional remittance providers. One thing is for sure: the customer always wins when the industry is being radically disrupted through innovation.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Strike&#8217;s remittance trial in El Salvador paves the way for the future of remittance payments, effectively driving the cost of sending cross-border payments to zero.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":34,"featured_media":7853,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":""},"categories":[268],"tags":[279,330,277,357,358,60,359,356],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v16.4 -

You start with essentials: creating a brand, a website, and buying a fancy coffee machine. The business takes off, everything is fine, and business is booming. Competition is fierce, and it tries to imitate your brand. You open a bottle of good wine to celebrate the fact that your company is worth imitating. Then you think about how to fight the dirty competition. Your lawyer suggests that you should trademark your brand. But no! You find out that the name you&#8217;ve chosen cannot be trademarked. It&#8217;s game over, at least for this solution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many business founders feel intimidated with buying a trademark, so they don&#8217;t do it soon enough. I have a lot of understanding for them: Buying a trademark can be a lengthy process with uncertain rules and results. It also costs a lot of money. Moreover, lawyers are involved, which makes it even more unpleasant and even more costly.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are the reasons why we&#8217;ve built Trama. With Trama, you&#8217;ll get the right amount of lawyers&#8217; support to do the trademark registration for you. We also provide a nice and quite unique feature: if your trademark registration is not successful, you don&#8217;t pay. In other words, the moment we say YourProductName can be trademarked, the financial responsibility is ours. If we&#8217;re wrong, it&#8217;ll hurt our purse. This means when we need to be damn sure about whether the registration will succeed. And since we register hundreds of trademarks each month, we need to be damn sure damn quickly.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this is precisely the moment when IT comes into play. What we need is one simple Google-like input, where a trademark attorney can input your trademark, and that&#8217;ll tell them what are the most similar existing trademarks that could interfere with your registration. But before we continue, let me make a quick intermezzo about how trademarks work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Three rules of a trademark registration<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First, your trademark cannot be similar\u2014in writing or phonetically\u2014to some already registered trademark. For this reason, you cannot register &#8220;Shelf&#8221; as a trademark for a chain of gas stations or &#8220;Nerd Face&#8221; as an outdoor clothing brand. The existing trademarks are like bullies in a high school: the bigger and more famous one is, the more distance you need to keep from it. If you break this rule, the owner of the established trademark can submit an opposition to your registration, which may result in your registration being dismissed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, meet trademark categories. Every trademark is registered in a certain category, and usually, there are no conflicts across categories. For this reason, you could register <a href=\"https:\/\/tramatm.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Trama<\/a> as a fashion brand, even though Trama is already a registered trademark in the Computer and Software Services and Scientific Services category. The simile with bullies applies here as well: Some trademarks are so powerful, they forbid similar names even in other categories. For this reason, you cannot register Adidas as a trademark for a seller of fresh vegetables.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Third rule: If it&#8217;s a generally used term, you cannot trademark it. For this reason, Apple cannot be trademarked. However, its visual representation, the famous bitten apple, can be trademark-protected.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, let us amuse you with some real-world examples:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>We wanted to register a trademark for VANAVITA, which a company with the trademark VITA opposed.<\/li><li>We wanted to register the trademark ELVIRE, which wanted registration in multiple categories, but specifically in the <em>clothing<\/em> category, it was opposed by a company called ELVINE.<\/li><li>We completed trademark registration for Eatster. Companies with the names Beatstar or Heatstar chose not to oppose the registration of that trademark.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>ML solution for the win<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>By now, you&#8217;re probably starting to understand why this is a complicated and fuzzy problem. And as such, it is a perfect fit for an ML solution. First, we need a proper dataset to train the model. There exists a beautiful set of successful and even unsuccessful trademark registration attempts. The problem? The really desperate registration attempts are not there, simply because an attorney hasn&#8217;t even submitted them. The ML approaches we&#8217;ve tried seemed to be quite confused by such a bias.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second problem was that Trama&#8217;s internal dataset was relatively small at the time of implementation, just a couple hundred trademarks, which made it unusable for actual model training. Well, they could at least use them later for validation of our model. So we decided that EUIPO data (a.k.a mapping from &#8216;text applied for a trademark&#8217; to a result of such application &#8216;approved\/declined&#8217;) is our best shot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, we need to do some preprocessing first. Data needs to be tokenized first: the trademarked strings are split into individual words. This is harder than it seems: sometimes the words are abbreviated, and sometimes they even come from different languages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next step was to enrich our data with phrases that we know could not be trademarked, and such trademark applications would be declined. Wikipedia has a corpus of English language. If a part of the trademark can be found here, it&#8217;s a bad signal\u2014trademark (or its part) is a word too common to be trademarked.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then we fed the data into elastic search to query for similar words, both syntactically and phonetically, as there may be some occurrence of leetspeak, for example. If there are many similarities found, then it is a bad sign, as well as there is a high chance of conflict with existing trademarks. Finally, all these inputs are inputs to the ML model. We&#8217;ve tried several models and finally went out with decision forests. We tried for our model not to fit the EUIPO data too much as we knew the data we were basing our decisions on were biased. For validation of the results, we were able to use our internal dataset.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The result of the ML code is the yes\/no verdict plus a list of trademarks that are most likely to conflict with the given trademark. The yes\/no verdict is currently not that precise; if we&#8217;d trust them, we&#8217;d bleed money. The list of conflicts is a much more valuable output. A sharp eye of a skilled attorney can quickly check whether something of it is a valid reason to push back the registration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s it. In Vacuumlabs, we focus more on deterministic problems than ML work. But still, I very much enjoyed this small project. It feels great to hop onto the completely unknown field (natural language processing and ML) and, within a few weeks, put together something that our attorneys can use to speed up their work. Even though the results are currently a bit hard to read, which is the main reason why we haven&#8217;t made this tool public yet. However, the Trama business is growing, and so is the demand for our tool&#8217;s accuracy\u2014and I&#8217;m looking forward to deepening my skills in this area more when we&#8217;ll push it to the next level.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You start your business.

Whether it\u2019s world-leading institutions like Standard Chartered and Raiffeisen Bank, or award-winning scale-ups, we\u2019ve seen it all. And often, we\u2019ve found it\u2019s the mindsets, not the machines behind a product\u2019s success. While there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all formula, we\u2019ve identified seven must-haves that banks need in their digital partner, to achieve long-lasting customer satisfaction.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are seven essential characteristics banks should look for in 2021 partnerships.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>1.<\/strong> <strong>Focus on seamless onboarding<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2020, a whopping <a href=\"https:\/\/www.signicat.com\/battle-to-onboard?hsCtaTracking=2da79644-753c-42a3-9570-0a1470d60bcb%7C30205d21-1f6f-4ad1-9d5e-0be7d9c7a1de\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">63% of customers<\/a> in Europe abandoned their digital application process, because it was too cumbersome. In 2021, onboarding customers must be simple and straightforward.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One bank that has simplified this process is Standard Chartered in Hong Kong, who launched<a href=\"https:\/\/issuu.com\/gigabitmagazine\/docs\/fintech_september2019\/12\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> an all-in-one financial app, Mox<\/a>. The onboarding process is simple and efficient. Just like a challenger bank, the customer can join at any time. This has proved to be a huge success. Within the first five months of launching, Mox has already picked up over <a href=\"https:\/\/mox.com\/media\/the-first-five-months-of-winning-your-heart-share\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">80,000 new accounts<\/a>(1% of the entire population). 55% of which were opened outside traditional banking hours.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Improving the customer journey with seamless onboarding can be done in many ways. One way that banks can do this for customers is with automation. We helped leading<a href=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/projects\/twisto\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> Czech fintech Twisto improve it\u2019s registration speed<\/a> using this method. Customers now benefit from same-day onboarding, whereas the old process took several days. Scalable and efficient solutions like this can be a game-changer for customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>2.<\/strong> <strong>A mobile-first mindset&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>62% of Europeans today are thinking of switching from physical banking to digital platforms, according to the latest <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mastercard.com\/news\/europe\/en-uk\/newsroom\/press-releases\/en-gb\/2020\/november\/life-under-the-new-normal-accelerates-digital-banking-adoption-across-europe\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">MasterCard report<\/a>. This is bad news for banks with unsatisfactory online services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smart phones are going to be the fastest-growing platforms for banks. Today, a staggering 69% of European customers think mobile-first financial providers are better than <a href=\"https:\/\/www.signicat.com\/battle-to-onboard?hsCtaTracking=2da79644-753c-42a3-9570-0a1470d60bcb%7C30205d21-1f6f-4ad1-9d5e-0be7d9c7a1de\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">traditional providers<\/a>. Tomorrow, it could be even more.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While this may feel daunting for some banks, it represents a huge opportunity for others. The banks like Standard Chartered who embrace technology can leap ahead of the competition, securing loyalty \u2013 especially with the next generation of customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>3.<\/strong> <strong>Give Generation Z what they are looking for<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Gen-Zs demand a lot from their financial service \u2013 and overall, they are not\u00a0 impressed. Over a third of Gen-Z Europeans think that their bank\u2019s digital onboarding process takes too long \u2013 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.signicat.com\/battle-to-onboard?hsCtaTracking=2da79644-753c-42a3-9570-0a1470d60bcb%7C30205d21-1f6f-4ad1-9d5e-0be7d9c7a1de\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">with 24% abandoning applications altogether<\/a>. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic struck, 60% of UK Gen-Zs felt that their online banking services were not <a href=\"https:\/\/f.hubspotusercontent10.net\/hubfs\/383715\/Content\/Olive%20-How%20Did%20UK%20Banks%20Respond%20To%20COVID-19%20-%20Report.pdf?utm_campaign=UK%20Banking%20COVID19%20Report%20&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=92739291&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--Z9ru4BoIyrT8s-5CRK46GPsDS77XL-2KYgKJRZJVvwhkjUVNTELmTqUDAPH_Z6POVSpy3sY9U8P1QKhwf3M1lFSrNdbhRARrKyNRmfFaFkvYgi0E&amp;utm_content=92739291&amp;utm_source=hs_automation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">good enough<\/a>.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finding a partner who can give Gen-Zs what they want must be a priority for banks in 2021. Remember that every Gen-Z alive today is younger than online retailer Amazon. For them, there was no time before the internet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>4.<\/strong> <strong>Take a holistic view of finance and the customer<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Customers today want to complete many different financial tasks, within the same platform. By 2022,\u00a0 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pwc.co.uk\/financial-services\/assets\/open-banking-report-web-interactive.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">64% of adults will have Open Banking<\/a>, meaning that they\u2019ll be able to link up their bank, insurance, investments and more if they chose to. Apps which do not think ahead and offer these capabilities are likely to fall behind.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why financial one-stop-shops are well suited for the future. Standard Charter\u2019s Mox, is a good example of this. The <a href=\"https:\/\/mox.com\/media\/the-first-five-months-of-winning-your-heart-share\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">top five services<\/a> customers look for within the app are savings, travel, insurance, electronic gadgets, and tax\u2026 clearly, they want a lot more than just their account balance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>5.<\/strong> <strong>An ability to build regtech, as well as fintech<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Compliance teams today have a struggle on their hands. They must keep up with regulations such as GDPR, MiFID II and PSD2. Added to this, they need to control financial fraud which <a href=\"https:\/\/op.europa.eu\/en\/publication-detail\/-\/publication\/4b62e682-4e0f-11ea-aece-01aa75ed71a1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">surged by 650% in 2020<\/a>.\u00a0 This is costing banks a lot of money. Over the past \ud83d\udc4ddecade, European banks Compliance costs shot up by 620% &#8211; from<a href=\"https:\/\/op.europa.eu\/en\/publication-detail\/-\/publication\/4b62e682-4e0f-11ea-aece-01aa75ed71a1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> \u20ac21 million to \u20ac151 million<\/a>.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compliance as a service is going to be big in 2021. Anything that makes Compliance cheaper and more flexible is going to be worth billions. Smart digital partnerships need to factor in regulations, as well as finance.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>6.<\/strong> <strong>Continuous product enhancement<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even the best technology gets old. Banks should look for partners who continuously\u00a0 improve the service. For one of our clients,<a href=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/projects\/kiwi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> Kiwi.com, we have performed hundreds of releases and product iterations<\/a> to keep the service at the very top of its game, contributing to a 20% boost in customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, sustainability will be massive in 2021. And so digital innovations which help customers reduce their negative impact will be valuable. One example is<a href=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/projects\/doconomy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> Doconomy\u2019s carbon calculator<\/a>, which we helped to build.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Banks can use technology to predict other trends too. Leading<a href=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/projects\/raiffeisen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> Austrian bank Raiffeisen<\/a> does this well, with a behaviour simulator for live banking interfaces.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>7.<\/strong> <strong>Engage employees<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When staff understands what the customers need and how the product helps them, they are more motivated. They come up with improvements of their own, while customers benefit from superb customer service. Research shows that companies that lead in customer experience have <a href=\"https:\/\/f.hubspotusercontent10.net\/hubfs\/383715\/Content\/Olive%20-How%20Did%20UK%20Banks%20Respond%20To%20COVID-19%20-%20Report.pdf?utm_campaign=UK%20Banking%20COVID19%20Report%20&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=92739291&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--Z9ru4BoIyrT8s-5CRK46GPsDS77XL-2KYgKJRZJVvwhkjUVNTELmTqUDAPH_Z6POVSpy3sY9U8P1QKhwf3M1lFSrNdbhRARrKyNRmfFaFkvYgi0E&amp;utm_content=92739291&amp;utm_source=hs_automation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">60% more \u2018engaged\u2019 employees<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, many banking staff are feeling demotivated. 42% of UK banks\u2019 own employees think their employer did not do enough to help customers during COVID-19. Maximising motivation with next-level digital customer service boosts satisfaction both in and out of the office.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To build successful all-in-one apps like Mox, it\u2019s critical to find the right digital partner.

It sounds too good to be true. It normally is.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If dragons could create successful unicorns, the rewards would be immense. Imagine the scalability, efficiency and agility of a challenger if they held the kind of account deposits you\u2019d expect to see in an incumbent. A case in point is <a href=\"https:\/\/mox.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Mox<\/a>, the digital bank backed by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sc.com\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Standard Chartered<\/a> in Hong Kong. The average account has a whooping US$10,000 stashed away. The likes of Revolut or Monzo could only dream of achieving such numbers. Their customers deposit a meager \u00a3300 &#8211; \u00a3500 a month, which tends to quickly vanish again.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Mox is a rare example, a diamond in the rough. Vast swathes of incumbent banks have tried and failed to crack the market. Walking through the graveyard of abandoned apps, in the field of digital banking and investment management, we can find the likes of UBS\u2019 SmartWealth, Investec\u2019s Click &amp; Invest and RBS\u2019 Bo among others.\u00a0So, what\u2019s the secret formula? We spoke to the pioneer behind Mox, CEO <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/denizguven\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Deniz G\u00fcven <\/a>himself to crack the billion-dollar code.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1>Independent technology&nbsp;<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Different from other banking apps, Mox remained fiercely independent. As G\u00fcven explains:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t use any existing technology from our mothership.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Mox was built entirely from scratch, so each technological decision was given a lot of thought. It needed to earn its place and add value. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cWe use technology to differentiate\u201d, G\u00fcven continues, \u201cBecause technology enables us to do new kinds of things, to change the mindsets, and change the KPIs\u201d.&nbsp;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditionally, incumbent banks\u2019 onboarding processes have been a real turn-off for customers. In 2020, 63% of customers in Europe abandoned their digital application because it took too long. Because of slow onboarding, 78% of banks say that they\u2019ve lost customers to challengers. But by using fresh technology, Mox neatly side-stepped this problem. Onboarding time takes just 3 minutes and 47 seconds, in-line with Revolut, Monzo and other challengers.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speedy and seamless onboarding is a huge deal when it comes to revenue \u2013 the lifeblood of any bank. Incumbent banks are missing out on a jaw-dropping $22.75 billion each year because their onboarding technology cannot compete with challengers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1>Micro-innovations<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Mox started its journey at the destination &#8211; with the customers. G\u00fcven reveals how customer-led research directed the technology, every step of the way: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cWe used ethnographic research to fully understand the customer. We identified 80 pain points and set about trying to fix each of these issues one by one with technology\u201d. G\u00fcven refers to these as \u201cmicro-innovations\u201d.&nbsp;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>One successful innovation was to create a beautifully blank card, without a long number, CVC or expiry date. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cWe realized that there\u2019s an extra sensitivity in Hong Kong with cloud security. This was the first numberless card in Asia by a bank\u201d.&nbsp;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Micro-innovations that enhance the customer are game-changing in the industry. Even the smallest differentiation can go a long way. You only need to look at the brightly coloured metal, wooden and even ceramic cards to see how challengers are clamouring for customers\u2019 attention.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Mox, who reached a staggering 60,000 customers after just 80 days \u2013 almost 1% of the entire Hong Kong population \u2013 a service-first approach was pivotal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1>Find the best people&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Finding the best people is key to unlocking success for G\u00fcven, who conducted more than 1,200 interviews to build his dream team. G\u00fcven looks for a specific trait in his partners and workforce. It\u2019s what he refers to as the \u201cMidas touch\u201d. Like the ancient Greek God, G\u00fcven looks for people who can turn things to gold with a touch \u2013 or add significant value quickly.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With each new set of skills brought on board, G\u00fcven improves the service for customers. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cYou need to find a partner or partners that you can collaborate with in a different way\u201d, he explains. <\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Vacuumlabs was one such partner, and our Midas touch was that we could use technology to rocket Mox ahead to launching.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p> \u201cThanks to you guys [Vacuumlabs], we accelerated to delivery!\u201d, elaborates G\u00fcven. \u201cIt was a really, really good experience for all of us\u201d.&nbsp;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In the world of digital banking, the right partnership can add significant brand value \u2013 both to the customer and shareholder., Marcus by Goldman Sachs also uses partnerships well. For example, in 2019, the digital banking app teamed up with Apple to deliver a credit card which integrates into customer\u2019s mobile devices. This offers a breakdown of spending patterns to help customers save money. It helps make them memorable and keeps them in-touch with their customer base.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1>Let the fintech lead the incumbent&nbsp;<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Even before COVID-19, it was painfully obvious that the dragon banks needed to digitise \u2026 or become a mysterious relic of the past. Each generation expects better digital experiences, and we\u2019ve reached a point where 62% of UK Gen-Zs last year were unhappy with their bank. To survive, banks must stop talking about their digital transformation strategy and start delivering on it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Achieving this will require significant digital upskilling, as an entire workforce needs to re-learn the way they do finance. A recent Hong Kong Banking report reveals that this will be one of the most intense challenges that the sector will face over the next decade.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>G\u00fcven, however, is approaching the problem in a fresh way. He\u2019s built Mox, with the intention that one day, Standard Chartered can follow in it\u2019s blaze.&nbsp;As he elaborates further, Mox is not just an app, it\u2019s the future operating model of the bank:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cThis is the most critical piece, and it was vital for me. Instead of just focusing on one mobile app, and pushing the technology and pricing, we decided to focus on a new operating model, which can bring us a lot of different opportunities and also a lot of chances to differentiate ourselves in Hong Kong \u2026 Let\u2019s build the future operating model of Standard Chartered!\u201d.&nbsp;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s a bold and strong statement, but G\u00fcven has researched and honed his product in extraordinary detail. As they say, fortune favours the brave. And, here at Vacuumlabs, we feel very fortunate to have been a part of the journey of building Mox.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Feeling inspired?

My name is Marcel and today I&#8217;m super happy to have Deniz G\u00fcven. The CEO of walks by standard chartered over in Hong Kong, Deniz, after releasing in September of 2020, you have achieved amazing success with the app.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have managed to reach a hundred thousand customers within just eight months. And also we, these mocks credit service for your existing customers in April, 2021. That&#8217;s super great. And we as vacuum labs are very proud that we&#8217;ve been on this journey with you from the very beginning. So thank you for accepting the invitation today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Deniz G\u00fcven: <\/strong>[00:00:41] Thank you very much for inviting me. This is a great pleasure to be here with you today and I hope\u00a0 that we will have a great chat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo: <\/strong>[00:00:49] Great. I believe it&#8217;s now been two years since we first met is that&nbsp; right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Deniz G\u00fcven: <\/strong>[00:00:52] Exactly.\u00a0 Maybe a bit more than two years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo: <\/strong>[00:00:54] Yeah, I guess you&#8217;re right. Maybe a bit more than two years. I mean, I still remember&nbsp; back coming into an empty WeWork which is a bunch of chairs, a lot of empty rooms and we&#8217;re just sitting in this meeting trying to see how this MOX can come into existence. That was really exciting time. Now all those rooms are filled. Take me back, taking back to the very beginning. How did you get started with MOX and the entire big vision?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Deniz G\u00fcven: <\/strong>[00:01:18] Sure Marcel, it&#8217;s a long story, but I will try to\u00a0 make it short. As you remember, maybe a bit more than two years ago, we started this journey with a lot of different discussions. Maybe not before that WeWork place, et cetera,\u00a0 there were a lot\u00a0 of\u00a0 discussions internaly. Everything started in Hong Kong with H gaming, our big data. Because when I look at other markets, for example, for UK, all these neo banks, digital banks, you know conversations they started a bit different than maybe organically, but in Hong Kong, HKMA and thanks to them, to be honest, they started this conversation in 2017 October. In October time, they said we&#8217;ll issue a virtual banking licenses in Hong Kong. Once we heard this, of course, it was a great moment for us to understand, okay what will happen in this market and how are we gonna manage this kind of a new dynamic? Because at the end of today as Standard Chartered, we are a huge bank, actually, especially in emerging markets. We are operating approximately 70 different markets and 28 retail markets, but almost all of them are emerging markets. And\u00a0 Hong Kong is one of the most important market for Standard Chartered, because we have a huge history here. First of all, we are the first note issuer bank in Hong Kong. I&#8217;m talking about 160 years ago. We are still issuing bank notes in Hong Kong, and you can see our names Standard Chartered.\u00a0 It&#8217;s a great feeling. But on the other hand, we got a lot of customers. It&#8217;s a very profitable business in Hong Kong and it&#8217;s a great franchise. And of course the conversation was at that time, okay, there will be virtual banks in Hong Kong, but do we need to get one of these licenses? Do we need it, or how are we going to operate it. That time we asked two questions. First of all, can we defend our market? Can we defend ourselves with our existing operating model? Now our existing operating model is great. However, it&#8217;s a bit more like a traditional model and that traditional model, of course, in a branch base, physical places with some supplement of digital channels. This doesn&#8217;t mean that we don&#8217;t have enough some strong digital channels, but at the end of today, they are channels not propositions or not operating models. And the second question was, can we attack this market or can we attack any market with our existing model? I think these two questions, they opened a lot of doors for us because the answers were: No. And that no, I think it was our starting point. And after that, of course, we had a lot of discussions with the top team and maybe try to explain what should we design, what should we\u00a0 build, what should we create in Hong Kong. Because the discussion or just answering these two questions was, okay, let&#8217;s do a virtual bank. But what is the definition of virtual bank? Because everybody&#8217;s talking about virtual banks, digital banks, neo banks, challenger banks. Who are they? What are they doing? And especially now, when I look at all this in a big banks and the big banks and the traditional banks and the global banks know they bring some challenger bank ideas, but have you ever seen a successful one? Because I&#8217;ve been in banking more than 20 years\u00a0 and it&#8217;s really difficult to be successful if you are really coming from in a big bank and you shouldn&#8217;t think only okay, let&#8217;s build a sexy app and crack the market. Unfortunately, there is no market like this that you can crack anymore. It was 10, 15 years ago. Because at that time, it was easier to go somewhere with a sexy webpage, with some pricing and good branding.\u00a0 It was easy, but now you can go mini markets and you can say this is my app super cool. But the customers will ask you: What is in it for me? And how are you going to differentiate in that market with your services instead of you know products, which we are going to talk about it. Yeah, of course we explained the situation and what I told to everyone, instead of building a virtual bank, because the official name is virtual bank perfect and especially in Hong Kong, let&#8217;s build the future operating model of Standard Chartered. I think this is the most critical piece and it was vital for me, instead of just focusing on one mobile app and pushing the technology and pricing. We decided to focus on new operating model, which can bring us a lot of different opportunities and also a lot of chances that we can differentiate ourselves in Hong Kong in this model.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo: <\/strong>[00:05:35] Wonderful. For some people that might sound very easy but tell me about the first days. What were your first days like when you arrived in Hong Kong?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Deniz G\u00fcven: <\/strong>[00:05:42] Of course the story, it sounds like a super easy, but as you said, I started with couple of people in Hong Kong because I used to live in Singapore for Standard Chartered, and I moved here to Hong Kong and I brought in a couple of guys in, from Singapore, from my existing teams. I took a couple of guys in there from this market and we started. When I first moved here in people, they asked me, Deniz do you know Hong Kong? Because Hong Kong is different. All these things you can see in different markets. If you ask my opinion, there are a lot of similarities between many markets, but of course there are some also uniqueness of the markets that you need to understand. If you can understand that uniqueness, then you can differentiate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo: <\/strong>[00:06:21] Okay. Okay. I get that. But there&#8217;s lots of similarities between may different markets and there are unique things to specific markets. So did you do any specific research, to figure out how this particular market was different and how&nbsp; would differentiate it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Deniz G\u00fcven: <\/strong>[00:06:34] At that point, we decided to do\u00a0 ethnographic research. That ethnographic research help us now to understand the daily life of the customers. It was a good understanding for us because we identified more than 80 different pain points in retail banking in Hong Kong. We decided to focus on these pain points. And on top of all these pain points,\u00a0 we started to build services, not products. Now this is critical, not products you know, but\u00a0 services. And under the services, we focus on micro innovations on the product level, and we try to solve the pain points. Being a e-bank\u00a0 in Hong Kong or in any market is not that easy. Why? Because first of all, you need to get to the right approvals from regulator or regulators. And of course, here,\u00a0 what we did, we wrote in a huge banking license. It was like Investopedia for me. It was like mine of second MBA. Believe me\u00a0 we did that in three months time and with a very limited and small team. In three months time, we submitted that and of course, you know submission is not enough. You need to manage your relationship with the regulators and you need to maintain a really good relationship to understand the needs of the regulators. Plus, you need to know, also understand\u00a0 what should you do on the customer side. Meanwhile, of course, there were thirty one applicants in Hong Kong for the virtual banking licenses at that time. 31 applicants from many other places, Europe, US, mainland China, Hong Kong, big groups, big families, et cetera. We obtained the license in 2018, sorry, 2019 March and it was a tough journey with a lot of questions and interviews and everything with our regulator. But thanks to regulator here, they help us a lot and I believe that\u00a0 we put the right relationship with them. We obtained the license. What happened between the license application and the obtaining to license? There are many different parties or different companies, and if they reach us out to understand, do we want to do some JV partnerships?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo: <\/strong>[00:08:30] Okay i get it. So do you believe you could be successful just on your own and based on this operating model or do you need the partners?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Deniz G\u00fcven: <\/strong>[00:08:37] Of course, what I believe and this is also a very important part of our operating model. I don&#8217;t believe that&#8217;s no, you can&#8217;t be successful on your own. It&#8217;s really difficult. Especially if you are building something from scratch. You need to find a partner or partners, that you can collaborate with them in a different way. I&#8217;m not talking about the marketing partner or database sharing or this kind of things. I&#8217;m not talking about these things. Or to be honest,\u00a0 in our case, we didn&#8217;t look at a partner just because of the capital injection or investment. Now we didn&#8217;t look at any VC money. We look at some partners who can bring us two important things. First of all, distribution channel, they can be digital or physical and the partners who can build services with us together to touch the data life of the customers. And I&#8217;m saying this now again, because as a bank or, all the banks, honestly, it&#8217;s really difficult to believe that we can touch the data life of the customers easily. At the end of today, you are becoming like a utility and you are losing that power and many different apps in your phone, they are becoming a major, you know, players. But how can you become a, become a, you know, a data player in their lifes? So it&#8217;s a critical thing, so that&#8217;s why we pick\u00a0 our partners.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo: <\/strong>[00:09:56] Okay so what partners did you choose? Which ones did you get?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Deniz G\u00fcven: <\/strong>[00:09:58] Today you know, of course now everything is public, we got Hong Kong Telecom and PCCW group. Hong Kong Telecom is the biggest telco company in Hong Kong. And PCCW grew up in general as a group they got more than 4 million customers in Hong Kong out of 7.4 million population. And the second one is of course the trip.com. They are the second biggest digital travel operator globally. Unfortunately, in this day\u00a0 it&#8217;s really difficult to talk about travel. However, travel would come back. We are praying for these vaccines and everything. What I believe is we picked our partners. We got our capital injection as well. We became a really well funded company. I was trying to hire you know critical people to the organization. It was tough Marcel, you were with us because especially if you want to deliver and build something quickly. I think we built this bank approximately in a 530 days. I&#8217;m not talking about the story that I gave you before, because in the beginning we were not in a build mode. Starting from build mode to deliver to market, I think 532 days or something. The delivering a bank. Okay. I&#8217;m not talking about a vertical FinTech. A licensed bank with a lot of governance, risk, ML, FCC, all these treasury liquidity finance systems with a new technology, which we didn&#8217;t use any existing technologies from our mothership.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo: <\/strong>[00:11:22] How did you do it Deniz?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Deniz G\u00fcven: <\/strong>[00:11:23] It was tough. And of course I picked up two different ways. As a combined way. One is of course, hiring people and hiring the really talents from Hong Kong or outside of Hong Kong. I did more than 1,200 interviews, Marcel,\u00a0 for different levels, CRO, CFO, CIO, or Head of compliance, or sometimes developers, sometimes\u00a0 marketers, sometimes digital product owners. I did. To understand what do we have in this market or globally, and brought the right people and right tenants to Hong Kong. The second way, of course, finding good partners like you guys in Vacuumlabs and accelerate the delivery. Thanks to you, I think we found a lot of talented engineers. Sometimes remotely, sometimes we were lucky at that time. I miss all those times so that you guys could come to here and we worked together in the same office.\u00a0 It was really, really, good experience for all of us. Thanks to you guys we accelerated to delivery. I think in 530 days we delivered the bank. we started with sandboxes, and then we deliver to some alpha beta. You can imagine we tried to you know fix the problems before we go live. And finally, 22nd of September, we launched the bank. And so far I think of the results are really encouraging. , I&#8217;m seeing really positive and encouraging results in Hong Kong. MOX right now I think it&#8217;s a very popular brand to people that they really like it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo: <\/strong>[00:12:55] This is great. I can really tell that you&#8217;ve done a lot of interviews about MOX at this point because you&#8217;re just basically going through all my questions at any time you say something i&#8217;m like oh i need to ask him about this you come up with the answer immediately. Perfect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Deniz G\u00fcven: <\/strong>[00:13:07] I&#8217;m really proud, you know that I can give you the answers. Don&#8217;t ask me any difficult questions. Otherwise, now I can answer everything.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo: <\/strong>[00:13:14] All right then. Let me ask you a simple question. And it goes back to what you were saying about the specifics of the Hong Kong market in particular. You came in from Singapore. You might have some experience with mainland China possibly, but tell me what&#8217;s what would you say makes hong kong very different compared to those other markets around it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Deniz G\u00fcven: <\/strong>[00:13:31] I think Hong Kong is a real hub in Asia. I think all of us know that China is becoming a big power in terms of financial institutions, fintechs, startups. I think there are a lot of good players in China.\u00a0 We can easily tell them that they are more valuable than European players or in the U S players. And Hong Kong is just next to China. And to be honest from my office right now, I can see the China. We are talking about this kind of approximity\u00a0 and this proximity gives a lot of power to Hong Kong as well. The first thing is enough trading in Hong Kong. It&#8217;s a super power, and I think it&#8217;s a very important part of the Hong Kong economy. And as being hub in Asia between China and other countries, it brings us know a lot of new opportunities. If we focus on banking industry, Hong Kong is still one of the most profitable banking market in the world. There are some reasons behind that. There are a lot of strong new global and local banks in Hong Kong. These banks are mainly focusing on high level high networks customers to private customers. But I don&#8217;t believe that there&#8217;s enough financial inclusion here. So when I say financial inclusion, I&#8217;m talking about giving the opportunity to everyone that they can consume as like in a private thinking customer from their services. Unfortunately, if you are not in that level in Hong Kong, getting to banking services from the banks, I don&#8217;t believe that there&#8217;s the right service level for the customers. So which we call it real financial inclusion. And we want to focus on this financial inclusion to give everyone in Hong Kong. It&#8217;s not dependent on how much you have or\u00a0 which demographic group that you are coming from. These are not important for us. We are not focusing on traditional segmentation models.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are focusing on directing of the clusters and these clusters are based on behaviors. So this behavioral motivations, behavioral clusters are much more important than the other. The first one is financial inclusion. Second one of course, in Hong Kong, even today, not only in finance industry, in many industries, it&#8217;s a bit difficult to see end-to-end services the banks, they provide&nbsp; channels. And they do digitalization instead of digitization. So what they do, they get, and they take their physical products. They put on to channels, digital channels, and they believe that this is the transformation. What I believe you have to do in a real digitization and you have to design everything end to end, that the customers can consume in a different way. Because today the model, our model is a bit different and that&#8217;s why we saw a lot of opportunities in Hong Kong that we can differentiate and it makes a lot of sense to us. The last thing for us, especially for Standard Chartered, it&#8217;s a great market to build the future operating model because we need that there will be some new players and especially in the traditional players in this market and they will come here and try to disrupt. Today they are here. I&#8217;m competing with mainly&nbsp; six different, a strong mainland players, China mainland players. There&#8217;s one local player here, other than that everybody&#8217;s coming from. It really which big technology companies and they already launched the banks. That was also important opportunity for us to defend our, one of the most strongest&nbsp; markets, from the non-traditional.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo: <\/strong>[00:16:49] Okay. So when you&#8217;re saying you&#8217;re building the new operating model or focusing on services rather than a product, how is it different from the other players on the market? How is that a differentiation strategy for you?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Deniz G\u00fcven: <\/strong>[00:17:00] It&#8217;s a very good question. It&#8217;s like combination of the minute. There is no one formula that I can share with you, Marcel. This was the formula we are differentiating it. No, it doesn&#8217;t work like that. Under the operating model I define 10 different categories there that I tried to put all together and combine them as one operating model. The first one is we started with new technology. Instead of looking at very traditional core banking system and our technology quite well, we didn&#8217;t take our core banking system. I don&#8217;t believe that may have a core banking.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo: <\/strong>[00:18:10] So if it is not a core banking system, what is it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Deniz G\u00fcven: <\/strong>[00:18:13] We have a service ledger and that service ledger it&#8217;s something quite different that we can create it, very building the bank and everything around sort of debt, a service ledger, we found same with new technology. Sometimes it&#8217;s a very important piece of this, but on the other hand, it&#8217;s not everything. If you focus on only technology, you made a lot of new mistakes, but we focus on technology just to enable some other things. This was the first one and the second one, and I will explain how using kind of technology to differentiate instead of using technology, just for technology. KYC redefining all the onboarding models, because if you&#8217;re a digital bank, you need to onboard the customers quite differently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo: <\/strong>[00:19:27] So what makes it different? Is it just really about introducing digital onboarding?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Deniz G\u00fcven: <\/strong>[00:19:31] And I&#8217;m not only talking about: Deniz you have a digital onboarding? Yes. We have a digital onboarding. Two years ago I told my people here that guys, can we onboard the customers in three minutes, fourty\u00a0 seven seconds? So that was the KPI. Marcel, this number it has been there since day one. And I told them\u00a0 can we do this instead of I&#8217;m going to give you guys some targets. Can you onboard 10,000 million the first two days or in a can onboard this ? Can we onboard to the customers in three minutes, 47 seconds. What happened ? One of our customers, like he onboarded himself in 2 minutes 47 seconds. Okay. So he was not one of us. We don&#8217;t know that customer, he&#8217;s not coming from a banking background or something. Because I tried and I couldn&#8217;t onboard myself in there in three minutes and we solve this kind\u00a0 of this. And this is why I, we are using a new technology, because technology enables us to do this kind of things and changing the mindset, changing the KPIs and quite differently. And other than that, AML, FCC, fraud systems. You need to know change it. You need to understand that, you know how you are going to resonate, how should these things in a resonate to the customers and how can we protect our customers from any kind of incidents within the models.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo: <\/strong>[00:19:27] Okay. So the elephant in the room is called bank, right? Did you use cloud banking here?&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Deniz G\u00fcven: <\/strong>[00:19:31] Clouds was part of our operating model. We are one of the first cloud native bank in Asia. And I don&#8217;t believe that this entirely full fledged cloud-based banking in Asia. I think there&#8217;s some different sizes, but we are fully cloud native. So imagine a bank, everybody is talking, we are doing cloud migrations and everything. Perfect. We are on clouds natively and we don&#8217;t have any service. No service. So this is the reality. Again, Marcel, I&#8217;ve been in banking more than 20 years. I know the service quite well. So being on cloud it&#8217;s magical.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo: <\/strong>[00:19:55] What do you mean by magical? Why is it magical?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Deniz G\u00fcven: <\/strong>[00:19:57] Why? Because you can create a lot of flexibility and also in the future this new operating model will create a lot of cost efficiency. In the early phases, it&#8217;s stealing an investment. On the long run, it&#8217;s going to be interesting case for us to run a bank entirely on cloud.\u00a0 Of course, marketing stack now we redefine it, the marketing tech stack under this operating model. For me, if it is not performance based it&#8217;s branding. If it is performance based can be physical or digital, if it is performance based and then we call it marketing. So that&#8217;s the critical thing of differentiation. And of course we are using some of the players, global players. And I believe that we created this strong marketing tech stack. There are many things to do, and we will continue like this. But so far, I think our digital marketing, our platform is marketing. It performs quite well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo: <\/strong>[00:20:44] What does it mean to be services led? How is it different from any other company that provides services? Can you please define this?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Deniz G\u00fcven: <\/strong>[00:20:50]\u00a0 So service led means you can do a lot of differentiations on the product side, what we try to do\u00a0 for example, if you will take an taxi from here and if you are using a MOX cards, this beautiful blue card. Okay. So you can sync with your taxi app and you can go to the Hong Kong airport. And normally it costs you like 350 from here to there. But what if MOX bank will inform you with a gentle nudge and saying that Marcel in the last three times, it was 350, 360. This time it did cost you 230 and there was no traffic today in Hong Kong. Do you want to check your taxi provider? So this is something we are trying to build and create here, which means not a service led bank instead of being a product. But on the other hand, of course we are doing product knowledge. I can show it easily. Why? Because there is no card number on it. There is no CVC or there&#8217;s no expire date. I think that&#8217;s the beauty of the card. So what we did, we realized that there&#8217;s an extra sensitivity in Hong Kong market, especially about the card security.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo: <\/strong>[00:22:00] Well, yes of course people are very security minded these days. So what did you do differently?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Deniz G\u00fcven: <\/strong>[00:22:03] We built this card with MasterCard\u00a0 and there&#8217;s no card numbers, CVC. If you are going to lose this card, nobody can use it on e-commerce transactions, et cetera. And it was the first numberless cards in Asia by a bank. I think, it was also good for us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo: <\/strong>[00:22:17] All right. All right. Tell me more. Sounds interesting. Any other similar things under this operating model?&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Deniz G\u00fcven: <\/strong>[00:22:20] One is hiring culture. We always believe that hiring culture is a very critical one and we hire people with Midas touch. Let me explain what is Midas.\u00a0 So Midas\u00a0 is a ancient gods in Greek okay. And this guy, I think he had some super powers or curse when he touched something, it becomes gold. But this is our hiring culture. And really, we want to bring people who can create extra value on top of it, who are okay, who are desiring to change. Of course, in our education, et cetera, everything is super important experiences super important, but can we hire people who are willing to change and also who are coming to us? I think this is super critical and we are pushing it. Ecosystem I mentioned about it, I think we got some super good to know JV partners. And of course, the last piece that I want to share now, under this new operating model, how we define, instead of focusing on market share, we are focusing on hardshare and if you are needing a market, you need to know, get the highest hardshare . If you will get the hardshare, you will get the market share. So this is our mentor. This is our operating model<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo: <\/strong>[00:23:31] Great. So what I&#8217;m hearing from you is that there&#8217;s a major focus on the brand, right? So similar to an Apple fan will identify as an Apple fan and live that brand in their life. That&#8217;s not really the case for banks. Is it? Like why&#8217;d you have a bank account of the particular bank? You probably set it up after you got out of high school or college, and most people probably haven&#8217;t paid attention to it. That is that right is that what i&#8217;m hearing correctly that there&#8217;s a massive focus on the brand that really identifying with what the brand stands for?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Deniz G\u00fcven: <\/strong>[00:24:01] We have that kind of an inspiration. It&#8217;s really difficult to compare\u00a0 MOX bank with Apple, maybe not yet, but in the future why not? It&#8217;s too early because\u00a0 we are\u00a0 very young brand. We got to know some, our inspirations, like each experience should be game-changer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo: <\/strong>[00:24:16] So what does a game-changer look like?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Deniz G\u00fcven: <\/strong>[00:24:18] So I&#8217;m sure you saw it more than 1000 people in Hong Kong, I&#8217;m not talking about paid media influencers. Okay. Forget it. That&#8217;s another thing. More than 1000 people from our customers, they share their unpacking experience on social medias. Did I \u00a0 ask them to share. No. And this is priceless. Why? Because, I didn&#8217;t ask, we didn&#8217;t ask and they are sharing it. Why? Because they really liked the experience and they are so proud of being part of that experience. If you can create this kind of services, then you know, you have a chance to differentiate and to be honest with you, you can be successful. And I&#8217;m thinking is only one thing, right? And the people who know there, they love our cards. We got also a metal card this black metal card. I know that there was a huge queue for the metal cards in Hong Kong. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m so proud of being part of this team. And I believe that we are on the right track. To be honest, we believe that this is a micro level product knowledge, but if you can connect this micro-level product innovation with your service level solutions, then I believe that you can be super successful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo: <\/strong>[00:25:26] What would you say were the biggest challenges for you to overcome with the past few years? What were things that you now look back on and say oh i&#8217;m really proud that we&#8217;re able to do this?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Deniz G\u00fcven: <\/strong>[00:25:34] Marcel. I think I should say the one thing we delivered this bank from home, literally. So imagine between, especially in Hong Kong, between February to August, September, we were at home. We didn&#8217;t come to office that much. Maybe two, three weeks we came. We were at home and we delivered from home. I think it was a big challenge. Was it different for different companies? Of course not. Especially in the beginning. Can you remember right? People, they didn&#8217;t know that, know how to communicate with this kind of video platforms. Today everybody&#8217;s expert. However, delivering a bank is a different thing because it needs a different coordination. It needs different kind of communication between the teams. Not only the delivery side So that&#8217;s why that was a huge challenge for us. The second challange finding the right talents and bringing the right talents\u00a0 to Hong Kong. Especially after COVID of course, it&#8217;s tough to ask people and travel here and hiding people from different markets to here. I think it&#8217;s still a big challenge for me, because I believe that there are some areas that we have to bring some experts from outside and of course, building talent pool. It has been a challenge for the last two years. Other than that, of course you are dealing with a lot of different banks and governance is important. Risk types are super important. I really take all these things extremely seriously. It&#8217;s not the FinTech company. So it was\u00a0 difficult for us to understand, adapt, change, and reuse it. Now that was a big challenge for us, but what I believe that we didn&#8217;t do anything like, okay, now let&#8217;s take it from a big bank and we use it. No. We didn&#8217;t do that. That&#8217;s why we gave extra reports\u00a0 to understand and rewrite and reuse in a different way,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo: <\/strong>[00:27:17] What are the recent numbers? What can you share with us?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Deniz Guven: <\/strong>[00:27:20] We reached 60,000 customers base after 80 days.&nbsp; I know, it sounds especially in some point in some European markets or US markets, Oh, then it&#8217;s only 60,000. Let me explain that. .&nbsp; MOX original almost 1% of Hong Kong population. So 1% of Hong Kong, the country population we&#8217;ll use your bank. So we can discuss this in four different markets. Is it really easy to do that, et cetera, et cetera. So that&#8217;s why I think the customer adoption, they really like it. They onboard their subs in a very quick and they start to use it. Other than that, we got actually the deposit balance. It&#8217;s interesting. Why? Because the average deposit balance right now, it&#8217;s around 79,000 Hong Kong dollars, which means almost 10,000 USD. So look all this, no challenger banks from different markets. After&nbsp; many years. Do you see this kind of average deposit balance? No. So this is the difference of Hong Kong. We bring a lot of new customers and good customers. They were craving for good service. So they are coming to us. And honestly,&nbsp; our pricing model is not predatory. We are not giving the best or even we are not first five, six best interest rates, bank list. That&#8217;s the reality. We are competitive partner. We are not the predatory, we are not doing any predatory,&nbsp; pricing to our customers. Even with that, once the customers, they start to use us, I think they love it. So that&#8217;s why I know the customer numbers are quite good. Deposit balance impressive, I should say. If I know of the other markets, it&#8217;s not comparable. Card usage, it&#8217;s becoming a much better every day. I still have debit cards,&nbsp; but I&#8217;m using the credit cards already on sandbox. So my card is a credit card right now. And hopefully sometimes in 2021, we will provide credit cards, to our customers in Hong Kong instead of only debit card. So it&#8217;s coming it&#8217;s on its way. What I see these, I know some really good results, but there&#8217;s one interesting thing of related with this hardshare because when I say, you know, hardshare&nbsp; of people, sometimes they think, okay, these are something high level marketing communications. So after 80 days on App store, MOX bank had more than 7,000 &nbsp; comments, reviews, and comments. And we got 4.8 stars,&nbsp; on App store . And very similar, on the Google play. It&#8217;s 4.5 stars or 4.4 stars. I think this is also showing us that we are doing something good for the customers and, Marcel you knowmuch better than me, you cannot get this kind of&nbsp; ratings,&nbsp; from the customers, if they don&#8217;t like it. You can&#8217;t. Impossible. So that&#8217;s why really good signs for us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo: <\/strong>[00:29:51] Deniz, I know you&#8217;re a very busy man, so I don&#8217;t want to take too much of your time. Thank you so much for joining us today. I bet the listeners really enjoyed this conversation and really just everything that has been going on over the past three years, coming in with nothing and building a full fledged bank over the course of a fairly short time in the world of banking. It&#8217;s been very incredible. It&#8217;s not a small thing, FinTech, but it&#8217;s a full on bank. It&#8217;s not repurposing existing rails out there. It&#8217;s actually building a full on bank. So I&#8217;m really proud that we could work on this together and really have the stuff&nbsp; that we have been able to produce together. And I would like to congratulate you on launching this. This has been an incredible journey and I wish you all the best over the next few years as this thing keeps growing and becoming. A bigger and bigger in the Hong Kong market. Maybe if you allow me one final question this is not only available in hong kong right there&#8217;s no way to get a MOX card and MOX bank account?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Deniz G\u00fcven: <\/strong>[00:30:42] For now, we are only in Hong Kong.

We have been actively involved in developing the Yoroi wallet (which stores your Cardano currency, Ada), as well as our own AdaLite wallet. In this article, we\u2019ll give you a breakdown of what we think makes Cardano interesting, unique and worth diving into deeper.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Cardano: the largest 3rd generation blockchain<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cardano is the 4th largest blockchain project <a href=\"https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">by marketcap<\/a>, and has gained a lot of ground over competitors in recent months, growing significantly faster than the crypto market on average.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The goal of Cardano is to create a general-purpose smart contracting platform that offers capabilities similar to Ethereum, but without being held back by Ethereum limitations. If Bitcoin represents the first generation blockchains (digital, decentralised money) and Ethereum represents the second generation of blockchains (decentralised contracts), then Cardano is a third generation blockchains. Third gen blockchains try to solve the biggest problems that Ethereum faces: scalability, better security, cross-chain interoperability, sustainability in their development, etcetera.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first big difference here is that Cardano uses a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, rather than proof-of-work as both Bitcoin and Ethereum do at this moment. The Cardano consensus protocol is called Ouroboros. The protocol is formally verified, and preserves security guarantees that are comparable to PoW protocols. The clear benefit of proof-of-stake however means that much higher transaction throughput and computational capacity can be achieved without the enormous costs and energy consumption of proof-of-work mining.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to Ethereum or Bitcoin, Cardano and other 3rd gen blockchains are thus able to offer much greater capabilities and computational capacity at a computational cost that is a fraction of these other networks, while still preserving similar security guarantees.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s kick things off by having a look at possibly the greatest differentiator between Cardano and most other blockchains: the process that governs its R&amp;D and development&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Scientific philosophy and peer-reviewed academic research<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we jump into any one particular aspect of the Cardano protocol, it is warranted to take a moment to discuss the process through which code gets brought into production, because Cardano is taking an unusual approach here.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cardano has made a name for itself based on its leaning towards a scientific philosophy that emphasizes peer-reviewed academic research and evidence-based development methods. This kind of process emphasizes quality of code and mathematical guarantees of security properties (so-called \u201cformal verification\u201d) over faster but more error-prone styles of research and development.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The result is a <a href=\"https:\/\/cardano.org\/ouroboros\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">verifiably secure<\/a> blockchain protocol, as well as a community of developers and academics that adhere to extremely high standards of quality and code security assurance.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Combined with the fact that Cardano is written in the functional programming language Haskell, it is relatively easy for Cardano to extend its core with additional capabilities while maintaining extremely <a href=\"https:\/\/why.cardano.org\/en\/science-and-engineering\/formal-specification-and-verification\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">strong security properties<\/a>. Smart contracting capabilities should be released to mainnet in mid-2021, and the fact that its smart contracting language Plutus is also functional and based on Haskell, means that also on the contract level DApp developers will be able to formally verify their code. This helps avoid potentially disastrous security vulnerabilities, such as witnessed previous with the DAO or Parity exploits on the Ethereum network.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cardano thus holds a strong position within academic and scientific circles, and has chosen a programming paradigm that enables formal verification of all key pieces of its blockchain infrastructure. The quality and security properties of its code base therefore provides a very strong foundation for anyone to work on.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Scalability<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One cannot discuss the merits of a 3rd generation blockchain without talking about scalability, since scalability is the main limiting factor or the Bitcoin and Ethereum network.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cardano will be composed of multiple layers. The foundational layer is the Ouroboros consensus protocol, and thanks to its proof-of-stake nature provides for a theoretical throughput at 257 TPS (transactions per second), which is an order of magnitude greater than Ethereum or Bitcoin currently enjoy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond the Ouroboros base layer however, Cardano is working on enabling a <a href=\"https:\/\/cardanians-io.medium.com\/hydra-cardano-scalability-solution-36b05ddc91cf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">secondary layer<\/a> called Ouroboros Hydra, which will allow a multitude of parallel state channels to exist, that only occasionally need to sync their state with the base layer consensus protocol. Through this approach thousands of state channels, or \u201cHydra heads\u201d, can exist and each process up to about 1,000 TPS. When deployed in parallel, this configuration will allow for throughput of up to one million transactions per second. We expect the Hydra to be delivered around 2022.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While TPS is the most common measure of blockchain scalability, transaction throughput isn\u2019t the only aspect that matters. Besides throughput, data storage must also be managed to keep a blockchain to a manageable size. For this, Cardano employs multiple strategies to reduce the amount of log data that each node needs to carry. Such strategies include pruning, subscriptions, compression, partitioning, sidechains and sharding.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Governance &amp; sustainability<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A final key aspect of a successful blockchain is its <a href=\"https:\/\/why.cardano.org\/en\/sustainability\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">sustainability and governance model<\/a>, to adapt to changing requirements or technological advancements over time. The ideal blockchain provides a path for efficient decentralised decision-making, as well as a reliable way for the community to fund further innovation and development.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To achieve this, Cardano has <a href=\"https:\/\/roadmap.cardano.org\/en\/voltaire\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a roadmap<\/a> for enabling on-chain governance as well as on-chain treasury allocation. A small piece of the block rewards are paid automatically into a Cardano treasure smart contract, and therefore continuously fund the Cardano treasury in proportion to the activity on the Cardana network. People with a stake in Cardano will be able to cast votes through the \u201cVoltaire\u201d on-chain governance network, and decide where funds should be allocated. In that way, Cardano follows it the footsteps of DASH and the likes, by providing an on-chain governance model. The first steps in this direction are already visible, with Project Catalyst \u2013 the first public fund for Cardano community innovation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides this roadmap, our experience has been that Cardano is currently governed by a very strong leadership alongside active teams of academics, researchers and developers. Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, was one of the original founders of Ethereum along with Vitalik Buterin, and has a very strong track record in the industry. The Cardano community is well-connected with the Haskell community, and thus has access to excellent development resources. For all these reasons, the way that Cardano is being led and governed is certainly amongst its strong points, and partially explains the market valuation of the network.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>In conclusion<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cardano stands out favourably amongst its peers for a couple of compelling reasons, and we believe that it is well-positioned to play a leading role in the crypto market in the years to come. The elements that we find most appealing about Cardano are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Proof-of-stake<\/strong><br>Cardano is the largest blockchain project based on a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm. PoS offers significant advantages over PoW in many aspects, and is mos likely the way to go for major blockchain implementations.<strong><br><\/strong><\/li><li><strong>Rigorous R&amp;D process<\/strong><strong><br><\/strong>Cardano stands apart for its diligent process, scientific philosophy and peer-reviewed academic research standards. All this leads to an extremely high quality code base. <strong><br><\/strong><\/li><li><strong>Contract and protocol security through formal verification<\/strong><strong><br><\/strong>All main components of the Cardano blockchain are formally verified, leading to high security at the protocol level. The contracting language Plutus will similarly allow developers to write high assurance smart contract code with relative ease.<br><\/li><li><strong>Clear roadmap to solve scalability<\/strong><strong><br><\/strong>Through RINA and Ouroboros Hydra, Cardano will be able to offer scalability at a level far above Ethereum or Bitcoin, to enable large scale real-world use cases across a variety of industries. <strong><br><\/strong><\/li><li><strong>Strong roadmap for governance and sustainable development<\/strong><strong><br><\/strong>Cardano takes the sustainability of its protocol seriously, and via an on-chain treasury plans to enable and fund further development in a decentralised fashion. There is a clear way to fund further development in the future.<strong><br><\/strong><\/li><li><strong>Proven team, high level of market capitalisation and decentralisation<\/strong><strong><br><\/strong>Last but not least, Cardano is run by an experienced team, has strong financial backing and enjoys a high level of decentralisation and protocol security.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Curious about Cardano and its developer ecosystem? Curious to play a role in developing the next generation applications on top of these new blockchains?

Gone are the times of Bitcoin being called \u201cfraud\u201d or \u201crat poison squared\u201d by major banks\u2019 CEOs and celebrity investors. Citi\u2019s report was written by a team of six professionals that know their subject matter. Moreover, the team consulted with some of the industry\u2019s foremost players, such as Nick Carmi from BitGo and Zac Prince from BlockFi.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin at the Tipping Point works as a great introduction to Bitcoin in general. It explains Bitcoin\u2019s cypherpunk origins, Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s design decisions, and major historic milestones. It spells the importance that censorship resistance and permissionless transactions played in Bitcoin\u2019s early adoption among libertarians, hackers, and yes &#8211; even some criminal elements. The study also points out that today, less than 0.5% of Bitcoin transactions can be characterized as illicit. And most of all, the report analyzes why Bitcoin is important and willful ignorance and dismissiveness come at a cost to their holder.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Bitcoin becoming an institutional play<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the early years up to circa 2016, Bitcoin was mostly popular among the fringe groups and risk-prone traders. In the 2017-2018 speculative bubble, a mass of retail investors discovered Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, namely due to the emergence of accessible crypto exchanges. And in the past few years, the industry underwent another giant leap, finally enabling institutions to come in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cFor institutional investors to participate in a new asset class, it must be underpinned by a robust infrastructure able to support an efficient market,\u201c write the authors regarding the gradual institutionalization of the Bitcoin ecosystem. This robust infrastructure is mostly characterized by the professionalization of three fields:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1) <strong>Data <\/strong>&#8211; there are two distinct groups of data within Bitcoin: market data and on-chain data. Market data access and analysis has expanded in recent years thanks to specialized analytics companies such as Coin Metrics, as well as reliable exchange APIs. On-chain data metrics and analytics also underwent a leap forward in recent years &#8211; a development partially motivated by a growing need to economize on ever-growing on-chain transaction fees.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2) <strong>Exchange and Trade offerings <\/strong>&#8211; In recent years, exchanges began to utilize FIX protocols (widely used in conventional finance infrastructure). New exchanges are nothing like buggy and hackable early exchanges. Derivatives offered by Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), Bakkt, and others are growing in volume and open interest, providing institutional players with well-known instruments such as futures and options contracts. Many institutional investors utilize Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the AUM of which has grown from $2 billion in December 2019 to $36 billion in April 2021.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3) <strong>Custody<\/strong> &#8211; safekeeping with qualified custodians is often a regulatory requirement for the institutions to acquire assets such as Bitcoin. The emergence of professional custody providers BitGo, Anchorage, or Unchained Capital has partially resolved the issue that has been preventing institutional entrance for years. But the largest game-changer was the entry of traditional custodians &#8211; Northern Trust, Bank of New York Mellon, Nomura, Standard Chartered, BBVA, and DBS have all launched institutional crypto custody solutions in 2020-2021.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"602\" height=\"459\" alt=\"image.png\" src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/3b6HXYRtHabycVXQYBz-sgPSC9sPx6rwtOowhMcIrcLaOAioLOCqt9dYkjMJlwzu-YFLMZJ-_QOF7L8oi5JWAXvP7IH-1qo9AePgJnH5t3MF-Mf0q4zDVE_f2BYjxoSCzsceqlZb\"> <em>Source:<\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.citivelocity.com\/citigps\/bitcoin\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em> Bitcoin at the Tipping Point<\/em><\/a><em>, p.38.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another major obstacle for institutional adoption was regulatory uncertainty. This has also changed in the past three years, and various rulings and statements on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies made a lot of things clearer. Specifically for banks, the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/occ-banks-stablecoin-payments\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) Interpretive Letter on Banks Using Blockchain Networks for Payments<\/a> is an important milestone, as it enables banks to use blockchain applications and stablecoins.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the question of who the institutional investors are, the authors give the following answer: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cTwo types of institutional investors are entering the market. Those looking to profit from market inefficiencies are helping to narrow the price volatility and provide more consistent liquidity and those with deep pockets that are bringing large sums of capital into the market, adding support to price dips as they build positions for a long-term strategies.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The first type of investor is seldom talked about, though very necessary for market maturation. The second type &#8211; \u201chodlers\u201d such as MicroStrategy or Tesla, got the most spotlight in the past year, as these reinforce Bitcoin\u2019s store of value narrative.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Store of value is an important monetary function &#8211; one which fiat money is gradually losing due to unprecedented monetary policies. But, as the Citi authors argue, Bitcoin can very well start fulfilling another monetary function: an international medium of exchange.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Bitcoin as a potential global trade facilitator<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p> <em>Source:<\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.citivelocity.com\/citigps\/bitcoin\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em> Bitcoin at the Tipping Point<\/em><\/a><em>, p.5.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is potential that in the future perceptions about Bitcoin might end up focusing on its global reach and neutrality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.citivelocity.com\/citigps\/bitcoin\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Bitcoin at the Tipping Point<\/em><\/a><em>, p.83.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Citi GPS report culminates with the main theme of Bitcoin potentially becoming a global trade facilitator. As shown in the picture above, the perceptions concerning Bitcoin have evolved over the years from the new type of payment system to an internet-native currency, a digital gold, and finally to a possible global value exchange network.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The authors offer the following supporting arguments for the potential perception shift:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1) <strong>Borderless design. <\/strong>No government controls Bitcoin; this neutrality can prove as a killer feature in a world of increasing west-east tensions. Bitcoin can become a universal settlement currency for cross-border contracts and transactions, especially in countries with high domestic currency volatility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2) <strong>Lack of FX exposures.<\/strong> Gone may be the days of multi-currency trade deals with exchange rate risks if Bitcoin is adopted as a universal settlement currency for multiparty deals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3) <strong>Faster, potentially cheaper money movements. <\/strong>Settlement in the Bitcoin network takes around 10 minutes when a sufficient transaction fee is paid. While on-chain transaction fees may be too high for smaller payments, it is quite negligible for payments of several thousand dollars and more, especially when the final settlement takes such a short time. And Bitcoin\u2019s Lightning Network offers instant, near-costless payments on top of that (mostly for smaller payments).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4) <strong>Secured payment<\/strong>. Bitcoin carries no risk of chargebacks or payment bouncing. The entity sending bitcoin has to have the money to be able to initiate the transaction, and when first network confirmations appear, it is impossible to revert the transaction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5) <strong>Traceability.<\/strong> Bitcoin transactions are transparent and trackable on the blockchain, full consequences of which are still to be discovered. The study\u2019s authors point out that smart payments can be built on top of transparent Bitcoin transactions, i.e. automatic payments conditional on previous payments, the flow of goods, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While this vision is highly optimistic about Bitcoin\u2019s future potential, the authors concede there are obstacles on the way. Capital efficiency, insurance and custody concerns, security concerns, or energy consumption worries are cited.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Bitcoin at the tipping point<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In conclusion, the authors remark that Bitcoin went from a ridiculed niche concept into a leader of a huge, growing industry, where even central banks are considering following the example and launching their own Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs &#8211; we\u2019ll cover them in the future blogpost). Bitcoin made this leap in little more than a decade since its inception. In this context, imagining a future where Bitcoin plays a major role in world trade doesn\u2019t seem so far-fetched.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Bitcoin being \u201cat the tipping point\u201d implies that it may also not make the final move over the crest. According to the Citi GPS team, Bitcoin has two possible futures: mainstream adoption, or speculative implosion. The implosion may come as a combined result of a shift in the macro investing environment (due to tapering of the loose monetary policies) and regulatory oversight chasing away the most promising Bitcoin developers and entrepreneurs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea that Bitcoin will either go mainstream or die is actually nothing new. In 2010,<a href=\"https:\/\/bitcointalk.org\/index.php?topic=48.msg329#msg329\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> Satoshi Nakamoto said<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cI&#8217;m sure that in 20 years there will either be very large transaction volume or no volume.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, the transaction volume has been growing at an increasing pace. And the big players like Citi are taking the notice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Bitcoin network is the first truly global payment system. It knows no borders, never closes, is not owned by anyone, and is accessible to everyone. Unlike traditional payment systems that exist on private servers, the Bitcoin blockchain is distributed across thousands of machines all over the world. Anyone can maintain their own copy of the shared ledger.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.citivelocity.com\/citigps\/bitcoin\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Bitcoin at the Tipping Point<\/em><\/a><em>, p.17.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n<p><a role=\"button\" href=\"https:\/\/ir.citi.com\/_tpHpW8MfaZ1QXwGmP1JGMGXXI95qXm3IMJzUJScLMb6XIjtOls6EbDehXMR3B_o9Opi7mdc5tQ%3D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><br>See the whole Citi GPS report here.<br><\/a><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Citi Global Perspectives and Solutions (GPS), Citibank\u2019s \u201cthought leadership\u201d arm, recently published a 108-page report on Bitcoin and its perspective to radically transform the global financial landscape.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":34,"featured_media":7303,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":""},"categories":[15],"tags":[18,279,82,335,330,277,131,22,119,120,34,27,136],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v16.4 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Bitcoin at the Tipping Point: Highlights from the Citi GPS Report - Vacuumlabs<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"How does recent Bitcoin report from Citi transform the global financial landscape?

And while our focus at Vacuumlabs was on building Fintech solutions, we were following the crypto space with great interest. We were playing with crypto, buying crypto, holding crypto, trading crypto, and generally curious about what this market might hold. The next logical step, of course, was to find out if we could successfully sell software development services in this growing market, too.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We decided we\u2019d build some sort of crypto-related product for ourselves, so we could show potential clients that we had what it takes to build good software in this space. The Cardano ecosystem seemed like the perfect playground, and a light wallet an obvious product to build.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Why Cardano, and why a light wallet?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the autumn of 2017 there were of course a multitude of projects to choose from. We decided we\u2019d want to dedicate ourselves to the Cardano ecosystem because of two main reasons: first of all we liked both the technology, and the research-based approach to blockchain development that they were taking. While many blockchain platforms \u2014 in a rush to become a market leader \u2014&nbsp;chose the philosophy to <em>\u201cmove fast and break things&#8221;<\/em>, the Cardano ecosystem stood out for their diligence, depth and technical commitment. Secondly, from a business perspective the Cardano blockchain looked relatively underserved, with many of the most obvious and fundamental building blocks of a healthy ecosystem yet to be developed. In particular, we saw a clear opportunity for a better Cardano wallet\u2026<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time, there were only two ways for people to hold their Cardano cryptocurrency, Ada: either you\u2019d have to download and run the official Daedalus wallet, which meant running a full node with a full replication of the Cardano blockchain, or one would have to hold their tokens on an exchange, which is against the spirit of many crypto enthusiasts and brings exposure to 3rd-party risks. The Daedalus option was too complex and cumbersome, while holding Ada on exchanges wasn\u2019t bringing the security that most users sought and had already come to expect. What Cardano desperately needed was a light<em> wallet<\/em> \u2014&nbsp;the equivalent of the MyEtherWallet Ethereum wallet, but for Cardano. And thus, we set out to build that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Building a light crypto wallet<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The principal way for a user to execute transactions on a blockchain is to run what\u2019s called a <em>\u201cfull node wallet\u201d<\/em>. The user runs a full node of the blockchain protocol, including a full replication of the blockchain in question. Every time the user opens the wallet, the node needs to synchronize and update, downloading the data on all new transactions that were made on the blockchain since the node was last online. This quickly gets impractical and annoying for most everyday crypto users.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A light wallet on the other hand allows a user to communicate with the blockchain via a more user-friendly mobile app or browser extension. The light wallet communicates with the AdaLite server, where a full node runs, and thus saves the user the headache of running a full node themselves. A light wallet offers a much better user experience, and \u2013 especially when combined with a hardware wallet to confirm transactions \u2013 offers excellent security properties, and protection against phishing and other web-based security threats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we set off to build the AdaLite wallet, we wanted users to be able to send and receive tokens, hold them, and see their balance. We also wanted to integrate with the Trezor hardware wallet, to offer users the highest level of security. And while these were only the most basic features, we knew we would be adding more features as the capabilities of the Cardano blockchain would grow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>First mover disadvantage \u2014 the challenges of building on top of a brand new, undocumented blockchain protocol<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Being amongst the first external developers to build something on top of the Cardano protocol came with some serious challenges, both technical and social. The first and most obvious one was the fairly significant technical challenge: when we started developing AdaLite, there was no public documentation for Cardano, no specs on how the transactions are created and serialised, and not much in terms of details on any of the other technical aspects of the Cardano blockchain, either.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To add to the complexity, Cardano is written in Haskell code. Haskell is a functional programming language. Functional programming makes it easier to formally verify the correctness of much of the codebase but also presents a programming paradigm that is quite distinctly different from what most developers are used to. Our challenge was thus to reverse-engineer the Haskell codebase, to understand what was happening at the protocol level, and then transpile the code to javascript so that it could be used for the wallet implementation. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another initial challenge we faced was not technical in nature, but rather a social challenge: when we started development, core providers of the Cardano platform such as Emurgo and IOHK suspected us of building some sort of scam wallet, and were reluctant and reserved when they noticed our eager interest. In a market as hostile and scam-ridden as the crypto market, you have to prove yourself before anyone will trust you.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Hello world<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>That proof came when we launched the AdaLite wallet as an open source project, open for anyone to inspect it\u2019s codebase. We launched it softly, with the only promotion limited to posting it on some Cardano forums, Cardano-related subreddits, and a few other places Cardano enthusiasts hang out.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We launched small, and grew relatively slowly. In the first six months, we had around 5 transactions per day executed on AdaLite \u2013&nbsp;barely enough to even be worth mentioning. Worse yet: many of these transactions were executed by developers for testing purposes! But we had a committed team, and we were slowly developing and growing. As we added more features, such as support for Ledger hardware wallets and other such things, the user base started to grow. People realised that we were adding new Cardano features really quickly, in particular related to hardware wallet integrations. We were&nbsp; sometimes even faster than official wallets in bringing these updates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where we initially were faced with skepticism and reluctance, the momentum started to shift. While early on we were looked upon as could-be-scammers, we slowly became more recognised in the community. It took a really long time, but AdaLite is nowadays recognised as a trustworthy wallet, and Vacuumlabs as a trusted development partner within the Cardano ecosystem. If people talk about official Cardano wallets they will typically first mention the Daedalus full wallet, then Yoroi \u2014 a light wallet that we helped develop for Emurgo after our success with AdaLite \u2014&nbsp;and then often AdaLite as a solid third option.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>AdaLite thus became a trusted wallet option in the world of Cardano, but our volume of transactions was still relatively small, and our revenues even smaller. For the first two years of its existence, AdaLite was purely a hobby project\u2026 albeit one that we pursued with much passion and enthusiasm. The big breakthrough would only come in 2020.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>When moon?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The big breakthrough for AdaLite came in the summer of 2020: Cardano rolled out an essential proof-of-stake upgrade that allowed Ada holders to stake their tokens to help secure the Cardano network, and earn tokens as stake rewards. Because most casual users don\u2019t want to deal with the underlying technical complexity of being a staker, they instead put their tokens into stake pools. The model is that stake pools take care of all technicalities \u2013 for a small fee \u2013&nbsp;and pay the investors the majority of their stake rewards after the staking period ends.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that upgrade in mid-2020, AdaLite suddenly had access to a much better revenue model: we could offer the ability for AdaLite users to use our staking pools, thus increasing convenience to AdaLite users while at the same time being able to earn enough revenue for the project to be sustainable by acting as a convenient staking pool provider.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What also helped, obviously, was the token appreciation we have seen since then. Compared to last summer, the dollar value of Ada is up roughly 10x, as is the optimism and trust in the broader blockchain market. AdaLite is currently servicing around 40.000 users\/month, and averaging around 1000 transactions per day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the next 6 months or so, we expect Cardano to roll out yet another essential upgrade that will bring smart contracting capabilities to the Cardano platform. This brings additional complexity, but also a new range of possibilities for what can be done on Cardano. On our end, it means that development for AdaLite is never really done: as long as new functionalities become available on the protocol level, we are committed to supporting Cardano users the best way we can. For instance, the anticipated smart contracting capabilities would mean we could look for ways to integrate with smart contract protocols built on Cardano, extend our support for NFTs, and allow people to interact with smart contracts in various ways.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All in all, we\u2019re excited about the success we\u2019ve had with AdaLite, and our development efforts have not gone unnoticed: we are proud to have worked for multiple core providers in the Cardano space, like IOHK and Emurgo. Since we got our toes wet with AdaLite in late 2017, we have also started developing on other blockchains, and we\u2019re enjoying every part of the adventure.<br><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Learn about how we built the very first light wallet for the Cardano blockchain, the challenges we faced as we launched and grew, and where AdaLite is headed for the future.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":9,"featured_media":7748,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":""},"categories":[268],"tags":[332,302,82,283,330,277,278,334,187],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v16.4 -

another episode of Banking on Air. My name is Marcel and I&#8217;m the host at Vacuumlabs, a solution-based tech powerhouse. We believe that the future is in communities when it comes to digital transformation and financial services. If you&#8217;re interested in hearing more about FinTech, digital banking or payments, please don&#8217;t hesitate to subscribe. So today on the line I have Nicolas from\u00a0 Emurgo .Welcome.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nic: <\/strong>[00:00:21] Thank you, Marcel. Happy to be here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel: <\/strong>[00:00:23] Welcome Nicolas. You&#8217;re the CTO of Emurgo. Can you tell us a bit more about how Emurgo fits into the crypto and blockchain ecosystem?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p> <strong>Nic: <\/strong>[00:00:31] Yeah, sure. Emurgo is part of a blockchain, well known out there called Cardano. And Cardano is\u00a0 actually not one company, but a group of three different companies and one of them is Emurgo, where I&#8217;m the CTO. Emurgo does investments, education, enterprise development among other things and this is how we collaborate with Cardano and so most of my work is related to Cardano. It is like pretty cool to be able to be working in the crypto space.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel: <\/strong>[00:00:57] So from the perspective of your day-to-day job, what does a CTO do at a Emurgo?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nic: <\/strong>[00:01:01] Basically we have like multiple projects running and I&#8217;m like responsible for overseeing most of the projects that we are working on. And also\u00a0 overseeing research for like future projects that we may develop. I need to be everywhere and to get to understand everything pretty well because honestly, people have me there to ask me the task.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel: <\/strong>[00:01:19] So what is blockchain?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nic: <\/strong>[00:01:20] Blockchain is this technology that allows multiple participants to agree in a specific thing that happened. And this is pretty cool because usually when you have information, you have this person did this, or this happened and more concrete examples. When you have multiple companies collaborating together, you need to have some sort of like trust or a way to be able to group the information together. And this gets to be tricky when you have like multiple databases and synchronization. So this is when blockchain helps. When you have multiple sources creating information, blockchains makes everything like simple and easy to digest. I think it is like a pretty good technology that&#8217;s like creating a lot of new possibilities especially in the crypto space, but also we are seeing some other possibilities more of like the enterprise part that doesn&#8217;t have\u00a0 the cryptocurrencies part.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel: <\/strong>[00:02:11] Yeah. So when you\u00a0 ask most people and you ask them about blockchain or cryptocurrency, most of them probably mentioned Bitcoin or Ethereum. But the way I see it, you and your ecosystem is almost like a third age of crypto. It sort of started with Bitcoin. It moved on Ethereum and now we&#8217;re sort of in the Cardano age of blockchains. Can you tell me a bit more about Cardano, the ecosystem and how it is different from his predecessor?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p> <strong>Nic: <\/strong>[00:02:37] Sure. That&#8217;s an interesting concept that you mentioned with like third generation. So first generation cryptocurrencies or something like Bitcoin, that basically you have a token and you can send or receive this token, but it does not have, for example, a smart contract capabilities in terms of Turing complete that you can like create programs on top of this token. And this is something that was possible with Ethereum. You have in Ethereum this base token which is ether, and then you can create like, even other tokens that use like Ethereum as a way to make this network work. But Ethereum was like a great proof of concept of seeing like, Oh, If we have a cryptocurrency will more like coding and programming capabilities, is this something helpful? And we have seen that there is a lot of like innovation going on, but then we started seeing all the problems that you only see when this is like in action. So how we can make this, like, actually not work with only like 15 transactions per second, but actually with hundreds of transactions with second. The protocol is working, but, uh, we need to do more updates. Who is going to pay for this? Usually with cryptocurrencies, when you start the project, you do the distribution, but then if someone is going to be working on this. Now there&#8217;s centralized manner who pays this person to update the protocol? This is like a common thing that benefits everyone. Where&#8217;s the money coming from? So that&#8217;s another one of the issues. . And also something that we have seen is that, there are multiple projects, we like different things going on and sometimes it&#8217;s like pretty interesting that you are able to communicate between different solutions. Because maybe there&#8217;s not going to be one clear winner. So it&#8217;s going to be important for the entire ecosystem, that one blockchain can communicate with the other one and you can send tokens and this could be like similar to banks, or even if you have your money in one bank, you should be able to send it to another bank and they can communicate with them, even if they&#8217;re in another country, or even in another continent. These are some of the issues that are part of the secondary generation and that&#8217;s why Cardano is important as a third generation to be able to solve like sustainability, scalability, security, and interoperability, which was some of the things that I touched there. So we did this proof of concept for the second generation and now with the third generation, we are going to be ready to tackle real world problems and scale up the blockchain industry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel: <\/strong>[00:04:54] Wonderful. So you mentioned banks as a potential use case. But I know essentially blockchain or Cardano could have many different use cases. I mean, thinking of supply chain management, healthcare, various sciences. Are there any examples of the ones that you worked on or that you just feel are really cool and that people should know about?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nic: <\/strong>[00:05:13] Yeah. There&#8217;s some really cool use cases and some of them that we have been\u00a0 working on is for example in supply chain with coffee producers. So something that&#8217;s going on is that for coffee, you have different qualities of coffee, depending on how you grow your coffee. For example, in a specific region in Indonesia, Sumatra,\u00a0 if you grow the coffee, like three kilometers above the level of the ocean and in a specific latitude, you get like a really, really good type of coffee. But usually what happened with the supply chain is that you need trust in other entities and some companies want to be like, &#8220;what can I do for you to trust myself so I can sell you coffee beans?&#8221; Because I have like a really good quality of coffee beans and to be able to assure that this is what you&#8217;re expecting. So in this case, blockchain is pretty good because we can be able to track different parts of the supply chain. For example, if you are producing a hundred kilos of coffee and you want to be able to duplicate it to 200, so you can be consistent with what you have and also because we&#8217;re like tracking how everything works. We can add points of validations for like different parts. So for example, it\u2019s common in the coffee process that also you&#8217;re going to have cuppers, which is our like wine taster people that specialize in like trying coffee. So they can tell you for sure that something is in a certain quality and the quality has not been mixed up or downgraded with other type of grains. Blockchain makes all of this easier to implement and I just think that with all the technologies, but it&#8217;s for work and at the end, engineering is about like making things more efficient and this is like a great solution for that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel: <\/strong>[00:06:48] Absolutely. So it&#8217;s really a way for manufacturers to really manage the supply chain, right. To have an audit trail, to see what has happened, how the coffee has traveled, where it was produced and have an independent body to all that, process. That&#8217;s really cool, so that you can really tell that the data hasn&#8217;t been tampered with and that you&#8217;re really getting stuff directly from the source from X to Y to Z, it can be proven. It&#8217;s almost like you&#8217;re a detective, that&#8217;s sort of trying to figure out how things happened and that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s really cool. Is that a fair summary?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nic: <\/strong>[00:07:20] Yeah, that&#8217;s a pretty good summary. And so this having a good impact on every industry that has a\u00a0 trust problem and for some of them they&#8217;re like pretty big like in coffee. What I&#8217;m expecting is that this is going to be seen in other industries as well. So for example, with soy, with beef, with so many other things that are mostly related to food.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel: <\/strong>[00:07:38] Switching back to where we started. So you mentioned banks, financial services. Do you see a future where blockchain will deeply impact financial services?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nic: <\/strong>[00:07:46] Blockchain for this could be like quite good, because internet is like this network of data and blockchain could be like this network for like financial assets where everyone is stuck in the same platform. So it could help doing all of this. We have seen that you can have digital dollars in the blockchain, and it&#8217;s quite amazing. You can send this so easily and we even invested in a project that&#8217;s helping people in need in various countries like Kenya, Vanuatu, receive humanitarian aid. And this done using digitalized dollars,\u00a0 stored in the blockchain, which is quite amazing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel: <\/strong>[00:08:19] Great. So what do you see as the most serious competition to Cardano right now, Nic?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nic: <\/strong>[00:08:25] That&#8217;s a great question and something that I highly believe in is that if you want to be better than another platform, incremental improvements are not enough. You actually need to be like 10 times better. And usually you only get to be 10 times better, if you do something completely different. I don&#8217;t know how well these plans are going to do. Usually Cardano takes most of my time, but I have seen some interesting stuff that they are doing. The first one that is a platform that&#8217;s doing something for me, pretty unique is Blockstack. So basically they are piggy backingon top of Bitcoin to be able to create blocks and to incentivize the block creation. They are giving rewards in a Bitcoin in Satoshis , which is like super interesting. So they are like building a smart contract layer on top of Bitcoin. We have heard of multiple platforms too in this like Rootstock, but the best of my knowledge, like Blockstack is the first one that actually was able to ship. We will see how they will evolve. The next one that I found really interesting, but also, I don&#8217;t know that much about them, is Solana. So what Solana was able to do is that they&#8217;re compromising in decentralization, but what they&#8217;re gaining is like they&#8217;re able to have a crazy amount of transactions, thousands of transactions per second, and also the price per transactions like a nano cents, something like really cheap. A couple of weeks ago, they hadan issue where the network like halted and they were not creating blocks, but they solved it. So I don&#8217;t know some of the trade-offs that they put in place to be able to have this level of transaction at this level price. It\u2019s definitely centralized similar to EOS In comparison with Cardano, I haven&#8217;t seen anyone doing something even like close in terms of flexibility, security. We will see in terms of a smart contracts how is like the adoption with Cardano. I think Plutuscould be quite interesting with a bunch of programming language, but this is that we will see.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel: <\/strong>[00:10:21] That&#8217;s very interesting. So, Nic, what is your take on decentralized finance? It&#8217;s been experiencing unprecedented growth in the past few months. Lots of people talking about it, lots of people involved in it. Is it really sustainable? Do you see decentralized finance as something that will continue to grow or is it something that&#8217;s going to fall behind?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nic: <\/strong>[00:10:37] Oh, interesting. Yeah. So just to mention, what does DeFi stand for, decentralized finance and the name&#8217;s a little bit confusing because what is decentralized finance. Right now it&#8217;s mostly two concepts like open finance that anyone can have access to and that they are built on top of a decentralized platform. Basically, most of DeFi is the use case right now is like lending and borrowing. For lending is that you can get like really cheap loans and for example, in the traditional world, getting a loan requires like a credit score check, identification, it takes some time and usually they are like above 20% interest rate are like sort of expensive. We have seen now in crypto, that if you collateralize your loans with crypto, you can get something cheaper and you have, so it&#8217;s just like, BlockFi \u00a0where you can get loans for like 12.5%. And then we see decentralized solutions for example, with MakerDAO and Dai where you can get loans for like 3% and they have been as low as 0.5%. There are multiple reasons why someone will ask for a loan, but this is like part of the system. The second part is the people giving liquidity for these lending. And for these the interest is that if you have a crypto, maybe you can get some interest rate on top of it. And this is the interesting part that DeFi getting a lot of that data is not so much about the part of life. Maybe in my opinion to borrow money, but we able to get interest with the money that you have. And we have seen multiple platforms like built on top of this. And usually if you analyze a where&#8217;s the money coming from is to be able to answer if this is sustainable, usually they come from two sources. The first one platform usage fees and the second one is about the interest rate, they, by the people asking for loans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel: <\/strong>[00:12:28] So what would you consider to be the most crucial components of these DeFi systems? Is there something people should really focus on, that&#8217;s the most crucial of them all?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nic: <\/strong>[00:12:37] I think it could be like, having to start a building. You need like really basic\u00a0 stuff for all the different blockchains, but after you have that, you need to start thinking of the next thing. So to put these in like more practical terms &#8211; everyone that wants to develop a, like a DeFi ecosystem is going to need Oracles. What are Oracles? It\u2019s basically this platform or it could be like a smart contract or it could be like something that helps you to be able to read prices or read information inside the blockchain in a smart contract information that&#8217;s from outside. What does this mean? So for example, you want to tokenize and have an algorithm that&#8217;s going to follow the U S dollar and you&#8217;re going to be using, for example, the native currency to collateralize this something similar, basically, a stable coin, MakerDAO You will need an Oracle system that&#8217;s going to be telling you what is the price between Ethereum and the dollar, so you can like make your algorithm work. So Oracle&#8217;s the first thing that we&#8217;ll think of. The second one is that usually you would like to have creating some movement around. And for that, usually people, a lot of people trade and what we have is that usually the dollar is like a median of exchange. And when there&#8217;s too much volatility in the ecosystem, a lot of people move towards dollars as like a storage of value. So having dollars in the ecosystem, is like quite important. And sometimes we see that for stable coins maybe another time we could talk more about it, but they&#8217;re like, there is not a one solution fits all, but it&#8217;s something like really required in the system. And some of the stable coin solutions also are able to do the system will be lending and borrowing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel: <\/strong>[00:14:19] So moving forward to Emurgo. Has Emurgo launch any of its own products, apps, or anything like that?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nic: <\/strong>[00:14:25] Yeah. For example, we have a crypto wallet, which is called Yoroi. Is available for desktop, like Linux, Mac, Windows, and also for iOS and Android. And right now we are around like a hundred thousand users. And it&#8217;s a lot of responsibility and we continue to bring you more updates and more features that we are implementing in Cardano to Yoroi. Unlike all the wallets out there. You want to use because you can take the benefits from Cardano. So for example, Cardano around four months ago launched a proof of stake. So actually we don&#8217;t work like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which is with proof of work, but actually we work with proof of stake. So this means that you can delegate your ADA, which is the basic cryptocurrencies of Cardano. So for example, for Ethereum there is Ether, for Bitcoin there is Bitcoin and for Cardano there is Ada .So you can delegate your Ada and get the rewards for participating in this industry, given the network. This is something that involves more technical things and not so many wallets allowed you to do that. So that&#8217;s one of the benefits from Yoroi.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel: <\/strong>[00:15:26] Great. So you mentioned Yoroi as the wallet, and that&#8217;s really where our journey started as Vacuumlabs and Emurgo. So, as some people might know, we built a wallet called Adalite, which is purely a web based browser based wallet. And this was something that we built internally because our CTO is a big believer in Cardano and ADA. So this was driven from the inside and that really started our journey to get it, right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nic: <\/strong>[00:15:49] Yeah. Like a fun fact, like when I heard that someone had\u00a0 like built a wallet for Cardano, I was so curious. And it was like, there is some part of that, how they do it, because there is not like a good documentation for that. And then when I started looking at the code, because he was open-sourced: &#8220;Oh my God. They were like reverse engineering. How everything works. Oh yeah, this guy&#8217;s really good.&#8221; And I really believe in show and don&#8217;t tell. So when you guys did this, well, I, need to meet this guy. They are\u00a0 quite good and we are always looking to be able to work with really good engineers. That&#8217;s why I met you guys and then right away, like, Oh, we want to develop all these projects we were looking for someone like you. We have even interviewed other companies, but we are always like, eeeh. And so I felt pretty lucky that we crossed and I was curious enough to review your wallet and realize that some of the technical decisions that you have taken were pretty solid. That&#8217;s why we started with our first project together, which was like the first version of Yoroi for iOS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel: <\/strong>[00:16:49] Beautiful. So I&#8217;m curious, what is it that made you say no to other vendors and go after us and convinced you that we&#8217;re the right people for the job?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nic: <\/strong>[00:16:57] A lot of people tell you, Oh yeah, no problem. I can understand that, I&#8217;m going to study and I&#8217;m going to learn this. Everyone says everything the same when someone actually has been through the trenches and has asked seeing all the difficult part and already understand something, it makes a lot of difference. And a lot of people even will say like, Oh yeah, you understand blockchain because I have done this project, but unless you put yourself with something difficult, I&#8217;m not sure if you actually capable of that. So that was something that you guys went through and yeah, I was quite surprised that you were able to accomplish everything that even wasn&#8217;t documented. So I couldn&#8217;t get any better than this. And that&#8217;s why I was really interested in being able to work with you because it&#8217;s difficult to find people that actually know blockchain right now. If you put blockchain you want to see Linkedln, hundred of people saying blockchain expert, you should run away from those ones, because\u00a0 no expert\u00a0 will ever put expert in their like title. The companies actually understand something in the deeper level, like not that many we have been looking for all over the world. Yeah. I feel pretty happy and that&#8217;s why, besides Yoroi, we have been continuing working in more projects and every time that we are like, Oh, we need to do more projects and we are not hiring as fast as we can.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel: <\/strong>[00:18:07] This is great. So is there any specific idea around blockchain that you would really would like to try out that nobody has tried out yet? Is there a right opportunity to start right now? Do you have something like that?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nic: <\/strong>[00:18:20] I have like an idea that we have been working with the team. I cannot tell all the details because we are still implementing it. But right now there is a really cool concept out there, which is stable coins. And everyone is following the concept of MakerDAO, which basically means that if you want to create a dollar in the blockchain, you need to have a collateral. What this means?\u00a0 You cannot create something from thin air and a collateral on the blockchain could be a crypto asset. So basically means that maybe you can put like X amount of crypto assets, and then if you over collateralized by 150%, you can create a 100% of the dollars. If the price goes down, you need to put more crypto. That way it&#8217;s always going to be collateralized. So the dollars are backed by something. Everyone has been following the same concept and right now, what we are aiming is to be able to create something that doesn&#8217;t work with liquid agents and is our work our way from like the MakerDAOconcept. We will see how it&#8217;s going to work. This is one of the things, but also another thing, like people that I am bank or semi bank crypto could be the solution, because right now it&#8217;s so easy to just have an app on your cell phone that could receive dollars and you don&#8217;t even need to know that this using blockchain. And this amazing thing that we are just after the stage where everything you need to be technical to be able to use this. And right now you could like, I know, talk to someone in stuff America that doesn&#8217;t know that much about computers or anything. They can get an app in the Android device, and then you can, through the blockchain, send them dollars and those dollars could be used to pay for stuff or they could change it for them local currency.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel: <\/strong>[00:20:00] Yes. I guess you&#8217;re just basically looking for a button to say, send this to my father who lives four countries away from me with a different regulatory system, everything. I just want to do it very simply at the same time, maintaining all the, I guess, international anti-money laundering laws, all the regulation. You want to keep everything going smoothly and nicely and done through a single button. This is really just an exchange of value between people. Yeah. Yeah, I agree. This is a massive problem. And this really needs a solution to make things really seamless and nice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nic: <\/strong>[00:20:33] Yeah. And to be honest, there is a lot of people there, like, years to the crypto space, they&#8217;re like, Oh, I don&#8217;t want KYC. I don&#8217;t want to follow AML. But usually the people that are more for saying something mainstream. For example, my dad, if he needs to download a wallet that ask him like, Oh, you need to take a picture of your ID to validate that this is you. Sure. I always do that with my bank. I do this with so many providers. So I feel like for some people it&#8217;s a big issue, but for most of the pro user base that could benefit from this, it wouldn&#8217;t be that much of an issue. So I feel like the space is going to start growing pretty quick, because we are not going to be trying to fight against regulation, but we are going to start embracing regulation some bill on top of that with a good UI that people don&#8217;t need to be technically savvy for this. And the benefits could be quite straightforward. For example, opening a bank account in Chile for dollars is expensive. It requires so much paperwork, but if you can do it for free in three minutes, it&#8217;s amazing. The payments of things are difficult in other countries because if you are not using dollars, sometimes you want to pay for something and in online and it doesn\u2019t accept dollars. So a really big company that was growing really fast in Chile was just a company that was selling besides gift cards in dollars. And everyone was buying them because as you mentioned, people wanted to buy stuff, but they couldn&#8217;t buy them. So a lot of times they will just buy the pirate version or trying to do something illegal because they wouldn&#8217;t be able to pay for something. But now that the world is\u00a0 more global and we are embracing other solutions, I&#8217;ve get to release here and people will have problems with doing some stuff. Sometimes when you want something and you don&#8217;t have a way to get at something, is when you start doing illegal stuff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel: <\/strong>[00:22:12] Yeah. This has been an interesting conversation about where you are, where you&#8217;ve been, where you&#8217;re going, where the ecosystem is going and where Emurgo is going. If people want to know more about Emurgo where should they go?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nic: <\/strong>[00:22:24] Uh, yeah. So for Cardano the best website out there it is Cardano.org and this website&#8217;s going to have all the information, what are the thesis behind Cardano, If you are a\u00a0 developer, what type of documentation do you want to read. If you are depending on what you&#8217;re looking for these websites to be able to route you or around pretty well. And for Emurgo, if you want to check out a little bit more of us, our website is Emurgo.io.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel: <\/strong>[00:22:51] Thank you\u00a0 so much for your time. I feel like technologies like Cardano are really changing the world and rethinking how we exchange value and information. So thank you for joining me today and I wish you all the best.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nic: <\/strong>[00:23:04] Thank you to you as well. &#8220;Muchas gracias.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"post__player player\"><iframe border=\"0\" class=\"player__iframe\" src=\"https:\/\/anchor.fm\/insidethevacuum\/embed\/episodes\/30-Blockchain-in-everyday-life-with-Nicolas-Arqueros-EMURGO-evoh20\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" scrolling=\"no\" frameBorder=\"0\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n\n\n\t\n\t<div id=\"podcast-subscribe-button-3988\" class=\"secondline-psb-radius-style\">\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n<div class=\"secondline-psb-subscribe-icons\" style=\"margin-top:-2em;margin-bottom:1em;\"><strong>WHERE TO LISTEN<\/strong> &nbsp;

Software development was our focus then, and still is. However, we have always known we want to go further. We wanted to build our own things, and build new products and businesses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So while we are still doing software development primarily, we have always kept our eyes open for other opportunities. As a result, we now have a set of projects and independent companies that were born and incubated at Vacuumlabs.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each of these spin-offs offers great opportunities for skill-learning and personal development as well as honing one\u2019s business skills. Many projects also present complex technical challenges and options for innovation and using modern technology that excite both juniors and very senior engineers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, I want to introduce you to a few of them, as well as the amazing teams that work on them. It will give you an idea of what these companies do, and also what it feels like inside the teams that have started these spin-offs. Get to know the other companies that make up Vacuumlabs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>AdaLite<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me start off with our most profitable and successful spin-off: <a href=\"https:\/\/adalite.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AdaLite<\/a>. AdaLite is a wallet for the Cardano cryptocurrency, Ada. Cardano is currently the 4th largest cryptocurrency by market cap, but at the time we started building AdaLite, Cardano was just a young niche cryptocurrency betting on proof-of-stake technology after many proof-of-stake currencies before it had already gone bust.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building a wallet for such a relatively new blockchain presented all sorts of technical challenges. But that is exactly what senior developers in the team liked about it. For over two years, we allowed this project to serve as a training camp for junior engineers and \u2018crypto virgins\u2019, despite the fact that the project didn\u2019t bring in any significant revenue. The reason though was simple: people in the team loved working on this product, and we were bullish on where the crypto space \u2014 and Cardano in particular \u2014&nbsp;could go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s how one of the team members, Miso Petro, described the experience:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cThis project helped me to engage with Cardano (and cryptocurrencies in general) professionally. Until I took over the AdaLite project, crypto was just a hobby for me. But this project lifted me to the pro league. It also allowed me to learn and get a pretty deep technical understanding of various crypto areas.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Building of AdaLite did good things for Vacuumlabs as well: it helped us win many more projects from both the Cardano Foundation as well as Emurgo, such as developing the now-popular Yoroi wallet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>ReactiveConf<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We started <a href=\"https:\/\/reactiveconf.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ReactiveConf<\/a> in 2015, when the React.js framework was still in its early days. Obviously things are temporarily on hold now, given the coronavirus situation. But for the upcoming 6th edition we expect to host 3 different stages with over 1200 attendants. That way we bring together React developers \u2014 as well as developers working on many other technological stacks \u2014 from across all continents to meet, talk, laugh, and make friends.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Soon after the success of the first edition, we spun ReactiveConf into its own company, headed by someone who embodies everything ReactiveConf stands for: Miki.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cI was hired as the 23rd person in the company. I was the first person who the board put in charge of our very first spin-off, ReactiveConf. My goal was simple: to take it to another level, to make it from a local conference to a worldwide one. And that\u2019s exactly what I did. <\/p><p>The only thing Matej, our CXO, told me, was: &#8216;Miki, work, so everything is good.&#8217; And I do that till this day and say the same thing to my team members all the time. I love the courage and trust the board has given me that day, because it has transformed me as a person.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Through Miki\u2019s relentless energy and spirit of hard work, as well as the hard work of the entire ReactiveConf team, it\u2019s now one of the leading front-end development conferences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Sparring, Trama\u2122 and Verdicto<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Who would have thought that our legal team would be the most entrepreneurial types within the company? Yet <a href=\"https:\/\/sparring.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Sparring<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/tramatm.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Trama\u2122<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.verdikto.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Verdicto<\/a> are all spin-off companies created by our legal team. Each of these projects are now independent companies that help entrepreneurs and business owners deal with legal issues more efficiently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s what Majo Porvaznik (CLO) said, when I asked him about his personal perspective on spinning out these projects while working at Vacuumlabs:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cIt is always thrilling to witness the birth of a new life, whether that\u2019s human or business. Thanks to the fact that these spin-offs operate in highly-regulated industries that are close to our core competencies in markets like legaltech or fintech, Vacuumlabs can provide a huge amount of support, in the form of design, development, network, resources and full infrastructure. Better yet: by growing the number of Vacuumlabs spin-offs, we not only increase their chances of success, but it also makes the entire group stronger and more impactful.<br>On a more personal level, I believe that \u2018growing projects\u2019 is the greatest skill one can earn when scaling Vacuum spin-offs. This skill runs deep into team culture, management, strategy and more\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Daylight<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With <a href=\"https:\/\/joindaylight.com\/\">Day<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/joindaylight.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">l<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/joindaylight.com\/\">ight<\/a> we took all the experience we had gained from building challenger banks for our clients, and used it to launch our very own challenger bank. Matej Ftacnik, board member here at Vacuumlabs, is an experienced venture builder as well as an LGBT+ activist. He suggested we build a queer bank, and \u2014 to add some challenge to it \u2014&nbsp;to do all the engineering and development for it in under 3 months. Four engineers got to work, and in the end it took a little over 4 months to build and launch the entire product.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Daylight launched successfully, as the first digital bank in the US that is specifically catering to the LGBT+ community. It shows how engineers in Slovakia can work efficiently for delivering excellent products that are used on the other side of the globe.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below is Matej, with some further comments on what the process of kickstarting Daylight was like:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cStartup DNA runs through my blood, and I love to support everyone who has the passion to create something new and meaningful, delightful and innovative that empowers people. I returned to building something from scratch recently, when I was behind the idea of Daylight. <br><br>As a member of the LGBT+ community, I face unequal conditions every day. Although we live in a very modern and progressive society, specific communities are still disadvantaged in different kinds of situations, which affects personal and professional lives of their members and too often does not lead to happy endings. For me, this project is the first big step in the fight for the rights of individual communities.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re proud that all companies within the Vacuumlabs foster a culture where great people feel included, no matter their background, religious beliefs, skin color or sexual orientation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All these diverse perspectives lead to new ideas, which in turn lead to new concepts and opportunities like these.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Rychlotest-covid<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, let me introduce you to a different sort of initiative we undertook, to help our own local community better cope with the challenges of the coronavirus pandemic. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rychlotest-covid.sk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Rychlotest-covid<\/a> is a spin-off dedicated to making COVID-19 testing readily available to everyone in Slovakia.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We started this project based on a single phone call: Ivan Kulich, the brother of one of Vacuumlabs\u2019 founders, is a prominent biologist in Germany. When I spoke with him in March 2020 \u2014&nbsp;very early in the pandemic \u2014 he told me that our communities were not doing testing at a rate anywhere near the capacity that would be needed to have a chance of keeping the virus under control. He convinced me that more testing was <em>essential<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Within days we assembled a team of enthusiasts, while Ivan connected me with the scientific community here in Slovakia. We started off, in summer 2020, by regularly testing our own team members. Once we had that covered, we encouraged other companies to come and use our testing facilities as well. Since then, we\u2019ve been leading the charge in bringing faster, cheaper and more widespread testing to Slovakia, with now 20+ testing facilities in operation all over the country, and over 100.000+ tests conducted in total.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While we increased our capacity for testing and operations, we also saw some opportunities to innovate on the way PRC tests are conducted. Those innovations enable us to now produce PCR tests for as little as \u20ac10 per test. How that works however, is a separate story, for another article.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The role you can play<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When I started Vacuumlabs a decade ago, I had a vision that we would some day be building our own products, besides doing work for clients.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, that is a reality. It is also something that really motivates many people within the company. These spin-off companies are the things that everyone \u2014 from new hires, to long-time colleagues \u2014 get excited about.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of our spin-offs are now successful, profitable, standalone projects. But above that, they have been the drivers for many people within our team to push themselves to their limits, and become stronger in the process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you would like to work in an environment where people:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>have the freedom to play around<\/li><li>try new technology and&nbsp;<\/li><li>build new products from scratch, I encourage you to visit our hiring page.

Where every other bank saw unacceptable risks and regulatory headaches, Silvergate recognized a huge opportunity. The key to Silvergate\u2019s success in the industry was strong leadership, deep industry knowledge, and active dialogue with the regulators.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>It all began in 2008<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been working on a new electronic cash system that&#8217;s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.\u201d <\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>With these words, Satoshi Nakamoto introduced his new invention of Bitcoin. The year was 2008, and almost nobody paid any attention.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the same year, Alan Lane joined the Silvergate bank as CEO\u2014Silvergate was a small institution established in 1988, with 40 employees and a modest $300 million in assets. As the banking world around was on the verge of collapse, nobody paid any attention to the small bank.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to many other US banks, Silvergate was in a very good position in 2008. Its board of directors suspected the mortgage market had been overheating for years already and things would get ugly sooner or later. Although the bank was mostly focused on real estate lending, they chose the path of deleveraging in an overleveraged market. As a result, the bank\u2019s balance sheet shrank before 2008 and grew between 2008-2013 with assets growing from $300 million to $800 million. The reason for such growth was that Silvergate remained one of the few banks capable of lending in the post-crisis environment, as its balance sheet wasn\u2019t loaded full of toxic assets. Huge demand for lending services forced Alan Lane to look for new sources of business deposits\u2014and he found struggling Bitcoin businesses, which were growing rapidly but were rejected by practically every bank in the country.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Knowing where to look<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cWhere other people see risks, oftentimes if you can figure out how to mitigate this risk, there\u2019s an opportunity.\u201d \u2014Alan Lane, Silvergate CEO<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Lane began attending Bitcoin conferences and talking to startup founders. In a community bent on building a bank-less financial system, a middle-aged banker must have stuck out like a sore thumb. Nevertheless, the Bitcoin companies\u2014especially the exchanges\u2014needed bank accounts and Lane knew it. He became passionate about Bitcoin and the opportunity it could bring to the small bank, spread his passion to Silvergate\u2019s board of directors, and got to work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first industry client that Silvergate banked in 2013 was SecondMarket, the first US regulated Bitcoin broker-dealer that was later acquired by Nasdaq. SecondMarket was an obvious pick for Silvergate, as the company was backed by professional investors like Chamath Palihapitiya\u2019s Social capital (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/funding_round\/secondmarket-series-c--0a4d4106\">Series C, 2011<\/a>) and had a strong drive to be regulatory compliant. The only thing that prevented SecondMarket from having a reliable banking partner was the irrational Bitcoin stigma.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the key reasons why Silvergate never got into trouble with regulators was the strong understanding of Bitcoin infrastructure. When onboarding clients such as SecondMarket, Silvergate requested transaction IDs (TXID) related to the client\u2019s brokerage\/exchange services. This way, Silvergate staff could check via blockchain explorer that the amount of money flowing through Silvergate accounts matched the amount of bitcoin sold and there were no shenanigans taking place. The transparency of Bitcoin blockchain was the key to risk mitigation in the crypto banking business\u2014but few banks made the effort to truly understand the nature of Bitcoin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Just the right amount of cypherpunk<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin arose from the<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cypherpunk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> cypherpunk movement<\/a>\u2014a hacker collective focused on increasing privacy and censorship resistance through technological means. Satoshi arrived at his invention by merging multiple technologies developed by active cypherpunks like<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Adam_Back\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> Adam Back<\/a>. The cypherpunk ethos within Bitcoin has been strong since day one, and this fact greatly helped in keeping Bitcoin open, free for everyone to engage with, and unchangeable in its key points, namely the monetary policy. Companies attempting to build their business on top of Bitcoin either accepted the nature of Bitcoin early on or learned the hard way later.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Silvergate and its clients, this manifested itself in accepting Bitcoin as it is and bending their internal policies to conform to the existing regulatory environment. Since onboarding their first client, Silvergate set up a strong compliance program and proactively engaged in dialogue with the regulators to explain in detail what they were going to do. Financial regulators usually don\u2019t like surprises, and emerging cypherpunk networks like Bitcoin are full of possible surprises. So the one condition Silvergate set for their potential clients was the willingness to fully comply with existing regulations. For Silvergate, the problem wasn\u2019t dealing with Bitcoin itself, but rather with the fiat infrastructure\u2014and this required full compliance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through this approach, Silvergate was able to expand its range of services offered to crypto companies soon. In the early years (2013\u20132015), providing the Bitcoin businesses with simple checking accounts was more than enough. By 2016 the industry and businesses expanded, and along with it the needs for further financial products. Silvergate had to focus on improving liquidity, eliminating frictions and counterparty risks. The main problem was that banking infrastructure was working on an 8\/5 basis at best (barring any holidays), while Bitcoin has always been running 24\/7. This discrepancy caused many headaches and lost opportunities for the Silvergate clients\u2014the banking infrastructure simply had to catch up with Bitcoin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thus the Silvergate Exchange Network was born.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Silvergate Exchange Network<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To truly become a full-fledged bridge between traditional finance and Bitcoin, Silvergate had to solve the banking infrastructure problem, which was that it worked less than 25% of the time (just 40 hours out of weekly 168). In the years preceding the establishment of Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN), Silvergate already had a solid API infrastructure in place. And Silvergate\u2019s API wasn\u2019t just the usual passive API for checking the balances\u2014taking a note from Bitcoin exchange APIs, the Silvergate built transactional APIs, allowing clients to initiate transactions without the necessity to log into the internet banking interface.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The transactional API infrastructure was instrumental in launching the SEN in late 2018. Under the hood, SEN is \u201cjust\u201d a network of API commands that makes global, instant, and free transactions in USD possible for the Silvergate clients. And since Silvergate already banked most of the US crypto exchanges, trading desks, and institutional investors, linking them all together via an instant transfer network was the next logical step.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By bringing USD transactions in line with the crypto industry, the following problems were solved:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>1) <strong>Capital efficiency<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Investors, traders, and other actors no longer need to hold large deposits at exchanges and trading desks, as they can move over funds whenever needed, be it day, night, or public holiday.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>2) <strong>Institutional-grade leverage trading<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Professional investors had a hard time entering margin trades before SEN, as there was no way to quickly move funds to the exchange in case of a margin call. Stablecoins were always a possibility, but these necessarily carry a risk of their own. Having the ability to instantly deposit real dollars made institutional-grade leverage trading possible. SEN Leverage, as the product is called,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/53033\/silvergate-bitstamp-link-up-to-let-institutions-trade-with-leverage-collateralized-by-bitcoin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> was launched in Q1\/2020 in partnership with Bitstamp<\/a>, one of the oldest and largest European crypto exchanges.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>3) <strong>Institutional-grade Bitcoin-collateralized loans<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The same benefits apply to bitcoin-backed loans. When borrowers can instantly and automatically pay back a part of their loan in case of a Bitcoin price dump to avoid liquidation, they will have a much easier time borrowing against their Bitcoin. This is potentially a huge market\u2014as Michael Saylor (MicroStrategy)<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=57B0XMHmBb0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> explains in various interviews<\/a>, there is no need to sell your Bitcoin for the next 100 years if you can borrow against it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a short time of two years, SEN has grown to almost $60 billion in quarterly transfer volumes:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"602\" height=\"316\" alt=\"sen-transfer-volume (1).png\" src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/YIws65vnHghSD_p058bqb2sHkFPV-jdaqlh22vgVa0s04LOYH8LQ8nVtZPDA7A_HI_sOcIDMna2F7KLPprf9xrjVERT2uFwbqilvAHIZ-2aEOpf2_KoSEW4zqJSW0NPbMqiNbFg1\"><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Chart source:<\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/data\/crypto-markets\/public-companies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em> The Block<\/em><\/a><em>.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How does Silvergate monetize the SEN? In two ways: first, it provides the bank with a very low cost of deposits (which fell over the years from 0.84% to 0.01%\u2014per<a href=\"https:\/\/s23.q4cdn.com\/615058218\/files\/doc_financials\/2020\/q4\/Ex.-99.2-SI-4Q20-Earnings-Presentation-1.20.2021.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> Q4\/2020 earnings presentation, p.5<\/a>) and allows the bank to expand its portfolio of conservative assets (mostly residential\/commercial securities and conservative loans\u2014same source, p.9). Second, Silvergate acts as a creditor towards its SEN Leverage clients, which generates attractive risk-adjusted returns.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Silvergate goes public &amp; big<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Silvergate went public in November 2019, when it offered 3,333,333 of Class A common stock to subscribers on the NYSE. The IPO yielded $40m at $12 per share. The subsequent Bitcoin bull market favored Silvergate\u2019s stock price as well\u2014the price has risen over 1,000% to the current $121 per share.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Silvergate currently holds over $5 billion in deposits, more than 95% coming from the crypto industry. Among Silvergate\u2019s 1,000 clients are the world\u2019s largest crypto exchanges (e.g. Kraken, Coinbase, Gemini) and all the regulated stablecoin companies (USDC, TUSD, Pax dollar, Gemini dollar). Silvergate\u2019s assets have risen from $300 million when Alan Lane joined the bank in 2008, to today\u2019s $5.5 billion\u2014an eighteen fold growth in 12 years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past year, other US banks have finally started to wake up to the trend and started providing the crypto industry with accounts as well. And not just any banks: JP Morgan took in Coinbase and Gemini as its first crypto clients; a huge step forward for a bank whose CEO called Bitcoin a fraud just a few years ago.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Competition isn\u2019t a surprise for Silvergate bank; the bigger surprise is it took so long for the other banks to do their homework and join. With a head start of more than five years and a growing network effect of the SEN, Silvergate has little to fear.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cGoing to the bank is an errand of the past.

Our Budapest office has become known internally for their enormous list of online team-building activities they hosted during the past year: Quiz night, Tabletop simulator, Among Us, Backyard, and more. They just seem to never have enough friendly competitions and challenges. And if the weather is good and there are no COVID-19 restrictions in place, they love to go out for a bike tour, play with petanque outdoors or go for a picnic. As if that isn\u2019t enough yet, it&#8217;s worth mentioning they are planning a trip to an Alpaca farm this year!&nbsp; If you stop by, our office manager R\u00e9ka will show you around, and if you decide to take a part in one of the competitive activities, watch out for our colleague Gerg\u0151 who somehow ends up winning everything.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cI love the team spirit on all levels and the tools we use on a daily basis, like Slack and Asana.

To everyone at Vacuumlabs, the Brno team is known as one big family that always likes to welcome both new people as well as teammates from different cities. Believe it or not, even some people from Bratislava \u201cgot adopted\u201d by the Brno team and have their own keys to the office as they love to spend time there.

We are now located in the unique SKYPARK multifunctional project \u2013 designed by the world-renowned architectural studio of Zaha Hadid \u2013 rather than on the top floor of a historical building in the city center. We are enjoying the perks of these modern and functional offices and the amazing work environment it provides. And we are less distracted and more relaxed because we have all sorts of handy conveniences and services at our disposal, such as a fitness center, cafe, restaurant, children&#8217;s center, postal services, grocery shopping, and many other nice concierge services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some things have always stayed the same though. We are still sharing this space with other successful companies, striving to make the Slovak market as strong and successful as it can be. You can still meet Matej, Samuel, and Tomas in the hallways chatting to everyone, as well as see Sima (head of our office managers) running around making sure everything works just the way it supposed to, hear loud screams from our game rooms (don&#8217;t worry, we have soundproof rooms as well) or find your inner peace on yoga class with Kika.

The general interest in cryptocurrencies skyrocketed again, which was reflected not only in the rising prices and arrival of retail and institutional investors, but also in the form of a huge influx of developers. According to the interesting <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/electric-capital\/electric-capital-developer-report-2020-9417165c6444\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">developers activity report<\/a> by Electric Capital, the number of new monthly crypto developers grew by a whopping 15% in 2020. And all this before the richest man in the world, Elon Musk, publicly expressed his support to Bitcoin (as well as Dogecoin) on Clubhouse and had Tesla buy $1.5B worth of Bitcoin just a few weeks ago.&nbsp; Across the world, Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is in the spotlight, and gaining incredible momentum.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ethereum.org\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ethereum <\/a>is clearly the leading Defi platform, but it has its limitations, as many DeFi users are surely finding. Although Ethereum has made great strides in terms of scaling developments, other platforms have also picked up steam. Today we can see a lot of smart contract activity outside of Ethereum, too. Here\u2019s our expert view on the top open blockchain Ethereum challengers in 2021.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1. Polkadot<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Founded by the co-founder of Ethereum itself Gavin Wood, <a href=\"https:\/\/polkadot.network\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Polkadot<\/a> has been one of the most rapidly growing crypto developer ecosystems over the last year. During this time, according to the Electric Capital report, the number of Polkadot developers doubled,. Today, the Polkadot ecosystem is the third largest in the world, right after Ethereum and Bitcoin. And while the mainnet was only launched in summer of 2020, it has already been a huge hit, with dozens of projects being built on Polkadot. Some of the best examples include blockchain operations platform Moonbean, self-upgrading smart contract platform Edgeware, multi-chain DeFi hub Acala and blockchain financial protocol, Akropolis.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Polkadot brings many chains together, enabling networks to scale, specialise and communicate with each other. The core of the system is built around an open source framework, known as Substrate. Substrate allows building application-specific blockchains, or in Polkadot lingo \u2014 parachains. This resembles the concept of sharding as the execution environment for dapps is parallelized, and thus the risk of network congestion is mitigated. Also parachains allow to adjust the blockchain architecture and design trade-offs with the Dapp needs in mind. These parachains connect through the central relay chain which is secured by a novel faster and more scalable consensus algorithm called Nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPoS). This mechanism breaks down into two main components with memorable abbreviations, BABE (Blind Assignment for Blockchain Extension) and GRANDPA (GHOST-based Recursive Ancestor Deriving Prefix Agreement). What is interesting about Polkadot\u2019s parachains is that they may feature different consensus algorithms and support different virtual machines, including EVM. This offers users the extremely beneficial combination of a modular framework with custom features, with optional shared security. This flexibility is likely one of the reasons why many developers choose to build on it, and why everyone in crypto should be paying close attention to it.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Cardano<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/cardano.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Cardano<\/a> was founded by another Ethereum co-founder, Charles Hoskinson. As of February 2021, it&#8217;s the sixth largest cryptocurrency. The mainnet, codenamed \u2018Shelley\u2019, was introduced last summer. And new smart contract capabilities are anticipated in the following weeks and months. Following this launch, we expect to see a huge spike in development activity, as deployment of DeFi apps gets underway. According to the latest data from <a href=\"https:\/\/outlierventures.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/OV-Blockchain-Dev-Q1-2021-_v6.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Outliers Ventures<\/a>, Cardano is the second most developed blockchain in the space, based on the frequency and number of commits. It is second only to Ethereum, and surely one of its most formidable challengers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cardano\u2019s smart contracts are written in Plutus, which is a functional programming language, based on Haskell. The language makes it perfect for high assurance code, as well as programs needing strong formal verification. While this certainly is a perk, aspiring smart contract developers can build applications on top of Cardano without having to learn Plutus, thanks to the recently launched K Ethereum Virtual Machine (KEVM). KEVM is Cardano\u2019s version of EVM, supporting smart contracts written in Solidarity. This opens up more synergies and opportunities for developers, as they can connect with other leading smart contract platforms. Support for popular developer tools such as Truffle is coming soon too, enticing more developers in. Cardano is the only blockchain on this list that is UTXO- based (unspent output), compared to the account-based approach adopted by other challengers. With UTXO, developers benefit from simpler parallelization of transactions in smart contracts, an increasingly relevant advantage in the space. Cardano\u2019s Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithms Ouroboros and Ouroboros Praos have also been a burst of innovation &#8211; even inspiring Polkadot\u2019s BABE component, mentioned above. Currently, Cardano is one of those more decentralized blockchains with over 1500+ validator nodes and hundreds of thousands of stake delegators.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cardano is making waves, and we\u2019re excited to see its ecosystem continue to grow this year.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And here at VacuumLabs, we\u2019re part of the Cardano family too! We\u2019ve single handedly developed <a href=\"https:\/\/adalite.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Adalite<\/a>, an open-source client-side interface for direct interaction with the Cardano blockchain.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also collaborated with major players Emurgo, Input Output and Cardano themselves, to create a light wallet for Cardono, Yoroi wallet.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/yoroi-wallet.com\/#\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Explore how we developed Yoroi wallet<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3. Cosmos<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/cosmos.network\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Cosmos<\/a> is another stand-out technology, attracting many developers. Its ecosystem has seen a consistent rise in core development and developer contribution. Similar to Polkadot and Avalanche, Cosmos\u2019 architecture features application-specific chains connected via a network of \u201czones\u201d and \u201chubs\u201d. The communication between them is facilitated by Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol (IBC). And the whole system is secured by the Byzantine Fault-Tolerant consensus, developed by Tendermint. This makes it a secure and flexible platform, ideal for developers. In addition, Cosmos is one of the few blockchain ecosystems exhibiting higher levels of maturity and development when it comes to DeFi space. There are already dozens of DeFi projects active on some of its chains such as Oasis Network or Secret Network with both focusing on privacy-centric execution of smart contracts. More chains, as well as applications, are anticipated, making it a very exciting time for Cosmos developers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently Cosmos made headlines as it became the platform of choice for global blockchain BitCana, which specialises in cannabis sales. The technology was revered by BitCana for its strong performance in a testnet environment.&nbsp; We\u2019d expect to see more moves to Cosmos in the near future, making it one to watch!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4. Avalanche<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Although <a href=\"https:\/\/www.avalabs.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Avalanche<\/a> may be the newest in our list, launching its maintest in September 2020, it is no less impressive. Since launching, it&#8217;s seen a jaw-dropping interest, with developer activity tripling, and its token prices rocketing more than tenfold. The system was spearheaded by Ava Labs, and led by another well-known name in crypto, computer scientist, and Cornell Professor Emin G\u00fcn Sirer. Sirer is best known for designing P2P cash systems, improving consensus algorithms and predicting various hacks, so he is certainly no stranger to pioneering in the space. You can read an in-depth <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/coin-story\/coin-perspective-10-emin-g%C3%BCn-sirer-25db40e4b467\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">interview<\/a> with him here.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with Cosmos and Polkadot, Avalanche is considered to be one of the \u2018Layer Zero\u2019 platforms. This is a new addition to the blockchain lingo, meaning that it uses a multi-chain ecosystem. These chains &#8211; dubbed \u2018sub-nets\u2019 &#8211; are special because they enable developers to implement chains with a custom virtual machine, or consensus mechanism. Avalanche implements a uniquely scalable consensus, considered to be a breakthrough by multiple high profile in the crypto space, including Ethereum co-founder, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/VitalikButerin\/status\/1229908044714086401\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Vitalik Buterin<\/a>. It supports high throughput, quick finality, and lightweight clients. Interestingly, the protocol was originally proposed by \u2018Team Rocket\u2019, an anonymous team of researchers who first published it in 2018.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It almost goes without saying that Avalanche supports EVM, offering developers a seamless migration for Solidity-based dapps. Over the past months, we\u2019ve seen a rapid rise in <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/avalancheavax\/securitize-becomes-first-security-token-platform-to-integrate-with-avalanche-2faa298bb195\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">projects<\/a> migrating to Avalanche. This is likely because its technology scales well, and enables sub-second settlement times &#8211; which is quite a big deal for the financial sector. The dark horse in the race, Avalanche is fast becoming a favourite for developers, companies and investors.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5. Near<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/near.org\/\">Near<\/a> is another platform that launched its mainnet in 2020. Unlike many other platforms, Near started its mainnet right away with sharding, a technique used to achieve scalability in blockchain. In other words, the very same sharding we\u2019re still waiting for Ethereum 2.0 to achieve, at some point hopefully this year. Near&#8217;s scaling capabilities, therefore, are pretty decent, and perhaps this is why Near has been recognized as one of the most serious Ethereum challengers by Ethereum co-founder himself, Vitalik Buterin. While the platform supports EVM to a large extent, it moved away from Solidity to Near Rust SDK. This should be reflected in the increased performance and speed. In addition, the team also introduced an ETH-NEAR Rainbow bridge that permits assets to move between Ethereum and Near. Moreover, Near includes an interesting feature that channels 30% of the transaction fees generated by the smart contracts to the DApp developers. This indeed is a powerful incentive for developers to build apps on top of Near, and another reason why it should be on everyone&#8217;s radar.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><em>Wrap up<\/em><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There is so much happening in the crypto space today, and Ethereum certainly has some very powerful challengers. Disruptive smart contract platforms such as Polkadot, Carnando, Cosmos, Avalanche and Near have different trade-offs when it comes to architecture and design, but we believe that these five platforms are the ones to watch. Forward-thinking developers should pay attention to them when choosing which platform they will build their apps on.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019d like to get more expert perspectives of what&#8217;s happening in the crypto space, as well as deep dives into the evolution of cryptocurrency networks, be sure to check out this <a href=\"https:\/\/coinstory.tech\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">upcoming open-source book<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Disclaimer: The author may possess small amounts of one or more of the abovementioned platform tokens.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you want to learn more about crypto?

Is it here to stay? Is it our opportunity to get rich? Or have we missed the boat already? Things we don\u2019t understand, especially new technologies, have a tendency to seem dangerous and risky to us. That\u2019s only human. But because blockchain and crypto have now been with us for more than a decade, we decided to shed some light on these topics. Helene Panzarino, moderator of our Banking on Air podcast, welcomed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/davidstancel\/?originalSubdomain=at\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">David Stancel<\/a> on our latest episode. David is our residential cryptocurrency expert here at Vacuumlabs, and CTO at Fumbi. In this episode, Helene and David discuss and explain the basics of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, and how this technology actually works.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>So how did get David involved in the crypto space?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cSince 2013, I&#8217;ve been studying Bitcoin and the many other cryptocurrencies that emerged after Bitcoin. And because they really represent a relevant alternative financial system to today\u2019s legacy financial system, it&#8217;s been a hell of a ride.\u201d &#8211; David Stancel<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Did you know that the first digital currency was developed in 1990? But it failed, along with a handful of other following attempts to create fully digital currencies. It took almost 20 years till Bitcoin was created and digital currencies became something that could be used in real life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cIt was clear that if we should have a successful and truly digital currency that is native to the internet, it needs to be decentralized. We cannot have a digital currency that is controlled by a central entity, whether that is a company, a foundation, an NGO or something else. We cannot have this single point of failure. It needs to be decentralized. It needs to be resilient to all kinds of attacks, including regulatory attacks and cyber attacks as well.\u201d &#8211; David Stancel<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>So how do cryptocurrencies work when compared to traditional systems?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cUsually, you have a central company that has some data centers and some servers that they&#8217;re administering and are in control of. Because they fully control everything, they can make sure that all the rules apply. The beautiful thing about digital currencies and cryptocurrencies is that there is no such entity in those networks. Anybody can join the network, which means that you basically download the software to a computer and you can run it on your computer directly and there are thousands of other people doing the same thing. It&#8217;s a very live and organic system.\u201d &#8211; David Stancel<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If a blockchain is such an open entity, is it then actually trustworthy?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, there are more open and less open ecosystems. And of course, attacks are possible in the network. However, they are unsuccessful because thanks to the way these networks work, they are able to defend themselves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cryptocurrency as a storage of value<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People are also usually afraid of the quickly changing value of cryptocurrencies. But if we take a look at real currencies such as the dollar, its value is not stable either and the future of the dollar is very questionable now. Let\u2019s consider that every fifth dollar that is currently in circulation, was printed last year. That\u2019s scary, isn\u2019t it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cAnd that&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve seen lots of not only small, but also institutional investors really deciding that they want to keep some of the cash reserves they have in Bitcoin and not in dollars.\u201d &#8211; David Stancel<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin has a fixed monetary supply. It has a set number of units that will ever be minted, so the amount of Bitcoins in circulation cannot be changed in the way that the dollar supply can change \u2013 by printing more and more banknotes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, there are also different cryptocurrencies than Bitcoin.<br>Actually, there are hundreds of cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is considered as a first generation blockchain, while Ethereum is the second generation of crypto.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cBitcoin was designed for really moving and storing the value on the internet and making some simple financial transactions. Another generation is Ethereum, which was designed as a truly global computer where you can basically program and upload any kind of applications and you can do much more sophisticated transactions.

They are my favorite tool to avoid nasty bugs and keep our code in a readable shape. Most importantly, knowing your code is about to be closely inspected by your colleagues applies healthy pressure to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">think before you code<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The code review process is often a lengthy one. It&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/palantir\/code-review-best-practices-19e02780015f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">certainly not a quick peek<\/a> into the code and concluding LGTM. A code reviewer needs to focus on so many things: Is the code well designed? Does it fit well to the broader picture? Are there some nasty bugs, not immediately surfacing in the tests? Then there are issues of performance and security, and finally, you need to consider structuring the code into functions and modules, naming, readability, and having comments where they should be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But even though it is a lot of work, I usually feel satisfied when giving or receiving a review, because it feels like time well spent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A friend of mine had a different experience: a colleague of hers requested several days of frustrating work to improve the readability and cleanliness of her code. The sentiment came from the fact that she was writing just a unit test. The test added very little value and probably shouldn&#8217;t be there in the first place. It was one of those sad tests, that are very closely tied to the actual implementation\u2014it&#8217;s passing until you change the implementation and at that point, you need to rework it from scratch. It was obvious that no one will ever read or debug such a test, its job is just to &#8220;be there&#8221; and then get deleted during the next bigger refactoring. But another reviewer decided it&#8217;d be good to write such a test anyway, and so she did.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the test was there and the first reviewer satisfied, the second reviewer came. For several long days, they iterated the naming of local variables, created helper functions, and altered syntax, as if it was the single most critical piece of code. What a complete waste of time!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Context matters<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The moral of that story isn&#8217;t that the naming of local variables doesn&#8217;t matter. It&#8217;s all about the context. For some code, you aim for maximum readability, because the error is extremely costly. Imagine writing a piece of <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/LedgerHQ\/app-cardano\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">low-level C code<\/a> that is responsible for moving billions worth of dollars every month. Surely, if good naming can prevent a bug in such a code, you want to spend some time on it! But polishing the naming in a meaningless unit test? That\u2019s quite a different story.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you forget the context, you&#8217;ll waste your time and frustrate everybody else with your review. My friend&#8217;s story outlines the first cardinal rule of code reviewing: the more critical the code, the more it justifies putting pressure on anything smelly\u2014and vice versa. But it doesn&#8217;t end here. As an reviewer, you may be tempted to object to other things, not realizing there is a good reason to leave it be. Let me give you some examples:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a rule of thumb, you want the author to avoid certain code repetition. But sometimes, you mindfully want to repeat some code, and refactor it later, when you find out what a good abstraction should be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or maybe you want the author to add something, such as better error handling, handling of non-happy-path, or improved logging. But sometimes, having a functioning and deployed prototype matters more than producing 100% perfect code a week later, just to notice that the business requirements have already changed in the meantime.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or you may want the author to write a code consistently with other parts of the codebase, that she maybe hasn&#8217;t thought of yet. I know from experience, because I&#8217;m often guilty of such OCD requirements myself. Sometimes it&#8217;s worth it, but surely it comes with a cost: consistency above a certain level is hard to maintain, especially in a bigger team, no matter what &#8220;Coding Standards&#8221; document you have. You need to be mindful of what battles are you going to commit to, because you are not going to win them all.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or how about wanting&nbsp; the author to write a code in a future-proof way? Sounds reasonable, right? But how sure are you, that your idea of what the future looks like is clear enough to justify that extra work? As the finance guys like to say: it\u2019s difficult to make predictions, especially about the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally\u2014my last example\u2014you may want the author to follow some dogma you consider a healthy standard. Healthy standards are good, but be mindful that there are also good reasons to break any one of them. Which brings me to my last point:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Don&#8217;t do dogma driven development<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The loss of context often follows from being too attached to a specific dogma. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>&#8220;A line cannot be more than 80 characters long.&#8221; <\/li><li>&#8220;Global variables are evil.&#8221; <\/li><li>&#8220;Avoid code repetition at all cost.&#8221; <\/li><li>&#8220;Function should do one thing.&#8221; <\/li><li>&#8220;There needs to be a unit test for all the code you write.&#8221; <\/li><li>&#8220;Variable names need to be at least 7 characters long.&#8221; <\/li><li>&#8220;The functional form of a statement is more readable than a declarative one.&#8221;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A junior engineer doesn&#8217;t know such rules and hence produces ugly code. Later, by adhering to such mantras, she writes more and more beautiful code. But to grow <em>beyond that,<\/em> and become a stellar engineer, she needs to understand that these are all just suggestions and best practices. Know the rules, so you can break them responsibly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there you have it\u2014that\u2019s the biggest mistake a code reviewer can make: to forget the context and ignore the \u201cwhy\u201d, before jumping into a code review. Not all battles are worth fighting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So before you add a demanding review comment, ask yourself: &#8220;Do I really think that the proposed change has a reasonable business impact? Or, am I just trapped by dogma?&#8221;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Gotten enthusiastic about great code reviews? Would you like <em>me<\/em> to be your code reviewer?

What would you go with?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is exactly the situation we found ourselves in, two years ago. We had several heated discussions about this between various developers. There were many opinions and arguments, a lot of languages were explored and considered, and their pros and cons voiced repeatedly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the dust settled, we had identified two and a half requirements that resonated most:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, we need speed. Not the Wall Street high-frequency-trading speed, but a very decent speed. The system today processes more than 10k updates\/second on a single machine. It also does lots of I\/O\u2014our database tortures the disk with 100MB\/s of I\/O, and machines running our code can easily top 200GB of logs per day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, we need extreme agility. The crypto space is often compared to a wild-wild-west, and everything can change in a heartbeat. New exchanges pop up and go bankrupt every month. Also, there are only two kinds of APIs: brittle and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bitmex.com\/app\/wsAPI#OrderBookL2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">extremely brittle<\/a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, we like to write code in a functional way, because it&#8217;s the easiest way to avoid bugs by design.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you probably already guessed, we chose Node.js and Typescript.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Node.js is faster than you&#8217;d think<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Backed by the V8, a Google Chrome Javascript engine, Node.js can in many cases have performance in the same ballpark as native code. Especially if you focus on the hot path and let JIT do its work there. Node.js is certainly much faster than for instance Python, and this is what Alameda Research (a big market maker in the crypto space) used <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/n85x_h21bGs?t=1492\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">for their first prototypes<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to C(++), Java, or even Python, Node.js has another nice property: it is designed with a non-blocking API first, and instead of using a huge amount of threads, it just runs a single event loop that schedules your asynchronous tasks. In the world of streaming updates from crypto exchanges, this is a very good functional fit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What about all that garbage<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Javascript is a garbage-collected language. GC pauses are nasty, but again, with the right design, you can optimize a lot here. You may be curious what the heaviest unnecessary-garbage producers in such a system could be. Well, the below were our two most relevant spaces for improvement:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. String concatenation<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Did you know that V8 can very efficiently concatenate strings? Values such as <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><code><kbd>const value = 'nodejs'+'surely'+'can'+'concatenate'+<\/kbd><br>  'strings'+'quickly'+'right?'<\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>are not immediately materialized into a single contiguous string. Instead, they are represented by a <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1o-MJPAddpfBfDZCkIHNKbMiM86iDFld7idGbNQLuKIQ\/preview\">special class ConcatStr<\/a>. This obviously puts a lot of pressure on the Garbage collector as many \u201chot\u201d strings in our codebase were produced by a logging\/metrics system that assembled the data using concatenation. We relieved some GC pressure by forcing V8 to flatten strings in our logging infrastructure. With 200GB\/day of logs, this is not something to be taken lightly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Data layout<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, when representing things such as order books, you would naturally use format such as:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><code><kbd>type OrderBook = {<\/kbd><br>  <kbd>&nbsp;&nbsp;asks: PriceLevel[], <\/kbd><br>  <kbd>&nbsp;&nbsp;bids: PriceLevel[]<\/kbd><br>},<\/code><br><br>where:<br><br><kbd>type PriceLevel = {price: number, amount: number}.<\/kbd><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using this design creates lots of tiny objects which means more work for GC. This improves rapidly, by just turning these objects into type:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>type <kbd>OrderBook = {asks: Side, bids: Side}<\/kbd>, <br><br>where:<br><br><kbd>type Side = {price: number[], amount: number[]}.<\/kbd><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Type safety is essential<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m sorry type-haters, it really is. Especially for a product like this one. We&#8217;re all well aware that type-safety doesn&#8217;t imply correctness, but if you can prevent a critical bug by writing proper Typescript annotations, surely you want to do that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In general, Typescript presents a great solution for Javascript&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.destroyallsoftware.com\/talks\/wat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">nasty surprises<\/a>. Especially if you adopt a culture of strict typing, code reviews, and linter rules. You can always opt-out to untyped code, for instance, if you are just prototyping.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Runtime Validation of External Data<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Maintaining correct typings for third-parties is hard. Many times, third parties will send you messages in a different format than they advertise on their documentation page. You definitely don&#8217;t want to execute some unintended trades and lose a lot of investors&#8217; money because a certain exchange suddenly sends you &#8220;1.234&#8221; (string) instead of 1.234 (float)\u2014which is exactly the kind of small-but-important difference that are surprisingly frequent occurrences with exchanges&#8217; APIs. Comparing <a href=\"https:\/\/bybit-exchange.github.io\/docs\/linear\/#t-getactive\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">this<\/a> to <a href=\"https:\/\/bybit-exchange.github.io\/docs\/inverse\/#t-getactive\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">this<\/a> gives you some idea.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To deal with brittle APIs, we need robust runtime input validation. We already have good Typescript type annotations, so the obvious design would be to generate a runtime type-check out of these. Many people have already solved this same issue, so this should be a piece of cake, right? Well, no. We&#8217;ve tried several libraries but none of them had all we need\u2014some of the libraries need a schema but do not produce good TypeScript types, while others were too slow to validate inputs.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, we decided to write a custom schema DSL and generator which produces both TypeScript types as well as a highly optimized validation routine. Part of our optimizations was a realization that we <strong>do not <\/strong>need to validate arbitrary Javascript objects. Instead, we always run validation on the result of JSON.parse(). This has a huge benefit because by definition the objects being validated aren\u2019t cyclic, and they cannot contain classes\/functions or other funky JS stuff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>JSON (De)Serialization is Surprisingly Slow<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This caused several headaches for the engineering team. There are several reasons why JSON is slow:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>JSON is very chatty. It introduces a lot of redundancy (i.e. long field names) in the protocol<\/li><li>JSON is UTF-8 based. This is a very nice property except that UTF-8, being a variadic-length format, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=wlvKAT7SZIQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">is hard to parse<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/li><li>JSON in our use-case requires a ton of CPU to constantly format floats as strings and then parse strings into floats, an operation we do a lot in our architecture.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, we cannot choose a data format when it comes to communicating with third-party APIs, but a majority of the traffic we send is between internal parts of the project. Therefore we&#8217;ve had the freedom to replace JSON with something else. After some experiments, we&#8217;ve gone with <a href=\"https:\/\/avro.apache.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AVRO<\/a>. For this, we heavily rely on our DSL schema generator, which can now produce both TypeScript types, JSON validation routines, and AVRO schema definitions. Think of all this as Google Protobuf on steroids. The result is a lightning-fast (de)serialization of internal messages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>It\u2019s Just the Beginning<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Node.js allowed us to build a working product quickly and get to know the space we&#8217;re operating in. Armed with this knowledge, we are finally ready to move to the next stage &#8211; a slow rewrite to a language with high-performance guarantees. After weighing all the pros and cons, we&#8217;ve chosen Rust. While it has a steep learning curve and has strict constraints on the design, it is very good at controlling memory and thread safety. This is exactly what you need when you need to go fast but can\u2019t risk losing your investors&#8217; money on stupid mistakes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Summary<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some may think that spending two years with Node.js just to rewrite the project to Rust is a complete waste of time. We see it differently though. Only in retrospect, we can see how crazily complicated our problem is. Would we start with Rust, we&#8217;d be both nervous wracks and probably bankrupt, too. As a good rule of thumb: properly understand the problem before investing a lot of effort into low-level optimizations.&nbsp;<br>If such an approach resonates with you, and you\u2019re curious to work on similar projects\u2026 <a href=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/jobs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">we\u2019re hiring<\/a>!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How to choose the right technology for a high-frequency trading project to execute trades on crypto exchanges?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":31,"featured_media":6786,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":""},"categories":[15],"tags":[138,269,275,131,288,285,287,286,270,289,291,329,290],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v16.4 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Lessons learned from writing a high-frequency trading engine in Node.js - Vacuumlabs<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"How to choose the right technology for a high-frequency trading project to execute trades on crypto exchanges?

It felt somewhat magical: submitting pieces of code to the almighty blockchain, letting the world\u2019s most resilient computer interpret that code, perform financial operations, and store the results forever. All this without KYC, and at the cost of a few cents.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People were fascinated and everyone guessed what the first practical use case would be. Then tokens came. They were a joke. Seriously, do we need a <a href=\"https:\/\/dentacoin.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">coin for dentists<\/a>? Or, <a href=\"https:\/\/bananacoin.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bananacoin<\/a>? But from an engineering perspective, everything worked fine and after all, some use case is better than no use case.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few years and one crypto-bubble burst later, the first big <a href=\"https:\/\/uniswap.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">decentralized exchange<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/compound.finance\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">lending platform<\/a> were built. Many more similar projects followed soon and the umbrella term <a href=\"https:\/\/ethereum.org\/en\/defi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">DeFi<\/a> was coined. And since Ethereum supports as many as\u2014hold your breath\u201410 transactions per second (tps), the transaction fees climbed to as high as $50 per transaction. The sentiment is that the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ethereum\/comments\/lffh25\/eth_gas_fees_are_too_d_high\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ethereum blockchain is clogged and quite unusable<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The mainstream solution<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So here we are: Ethereum finally discovering its first real use case, but almost immediately getting close to unusable under the load.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why is Ethereum so slow? With Ethereum, Bitcoin, and the majority of blockchains, every node receives, and processes, and forever stores <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/what-is-sharding-ethereum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">all transactions within the system<\/a>. Such a huge redundancy is a cost of the enormous stability and fault-tolerance that blockchains such as Ethereum guarantee.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The high-level solution probably won\u2019t surprise you much: Let the nodes work more in parallel. This means that every transaction will be processed by just a small fraction of all nodes. These nodes will find an agreement on what the transaction results are and update the balances on affected addresses. Inspired by database design, the system is called <em>sharding<\/em> and has become one of the most common buzzwords related to blockchain scaling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The problem<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me come out of the closet now: I\u2019m really skeptical about sharding and I\u2019m really skeptical about horizontal scaling proposals in general. While <a href=\"https:\/\/scholar.google.com\/scholar?start=0&amp;q=blockchains+sharding+protocol&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">it creates an interesting playground for scientists<\/a>, it may be beyond human power to engineer such a complex system.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me present three arguments why I think this is the case:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, let us compare with existing systems, that are trying to achieve <em>roughly<\/em> the same thing\u2014distributed databases. Reading through <a href=\"https:\/\/www.allthingsdistributed.com\/files\/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Amazon\u2019s DynamoDB<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/research.google\/pubs\/pub27898\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Google\u2019s Bigtable<\/a> design papers, these systems are an order of magnitude simpler than sharded blockchain. Yet it took a paramount effort to make such systems work properly. And the creators didn\u2019t even need to design for malicious actors that\u2019ll do everything possible to sabotage your protocol!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, the scaling issue is not anything new and history shows that it is indeed a hard problem. You may recall projects such as RaiBlocks (later Nano), EOS, or IOTA. They all claimed they fixed the scaling issue and they are all <a href=\"https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/17VoariX45RTcP4zN5t-qzz1Hvm2xXzWG\/view?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">pretty much dead now<\/a>. Ethereum&#8217;s scaling solution Plasma created <a href=\"https:\/\/ethresear.ch\/t\/plasma-world-map-the-hitchhiker-s-guide-to-the-plasma\/4333\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">more than 20<\/a> different design proposals and yet the project seems abandoned now.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, it takes years from the \u201cspec ready\u201d state to the \u201cproduct ready\u201d state. If the researchers cannot even write the specs, how many years are we from the launch?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To illustrate what I mean: the Ethereum 2.0 specification is <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/ethereum\/eth2.0-specs\/blob\/dev\/specs\/phase0\/beacon-chain.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">very detailed<\/a> when it describes the proof of stake part. But when talking about sharding it suddenly looks like an <a href=\"https:\/\/hackmd.io\/@HWeNw8hNRimMm2m2GH56Cw\/sharding_proposal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">introductory blog post<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Polkadot, a new kid on the sharding block, brings some really refreshing ideas to the table and I\u2019d like to see them succeed. They, however, don\u2019t give a definitive answer for implementing their no. 1 feature: checking the validity of the parachain state transitions by validators. The <a href=\"https:\/\/polkadot.network\/PolkaDotPaper.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">whitepaper<\/a> mentions zero-knowledge proofs, which is a fine solution for token transfers. However, as <a href=\"https:\/\/ethereum.org\/en\/eth2\/shard-chains\/#do-shards-need-code-execution\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Vitalik Buterin noted<\/a>, zero-knowledge-SNARKs suitable for powering up a smart-contract blockchain are not even discovered by scientists yet! This is certainly not a small missing detail in a protocol design.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the Avalanche ecosystem, you can create as many separate zones as you want, but there is no solution for zones to communicate with each other, so it\u2019s as good as \u201cscaling\u201d Ethereum by launching multiple separate ETH blockchains.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Near project has a <a href=\"https:\/\/near.org\/downloads\/Nightshade.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">very nice whitepaper<\/a>, and in my opinion, they get farthest in producing a proper high-level spec. However, as an engineer the whitepaper gives me the creeps: every other sentence in the design part represents months of engineering work. It\u2019ll take ages before anyone implements Near properly; Near is certainly not near.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Vertical scaling for the win<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine this situation: you&#8217;ve developed software for a client. Now the software has a problem: it cannot process the current load of transactions. All low-hanging performance fixes are already done. You are in a client&#8217;s place and have 12 hours to solve this. What would you do? The answer is simple: spend 2 hours migrating the system to the stronger AWS machine and spend the remaining 10 hours in the pub tasting the local beer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This approach is quite opportunistic and not very noble in my fellow scientists\u2019 eyes. But it has a few advantages: it works, it <em>probably<\/em> doesn\u2019t break anything and it\u2019s compatible with your taste for a good beer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A powerful personal notebook can easily transmit, process, and store 1,000 tps. That\u2019s a very practical 100x improvement over the current Ethereum throughput. There is no <em>fundamental<\/em> reason why Ethereum couldn\u2019t simply do the same. Fundamental is an important word here: it\u2019s certainly not as easy as turning the switch to 1,000 tps!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Solana is one project using such an approach. Their requirements for running a node are <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.solana.com\/running-validator\/validator-reqs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">much more demanding<\/a> than the Ethereum node. Apart from using the sheer power of their hardware, Solana engineers optimized like crazy on all levels of the system: They write smart contracts in low-level languages such as Rust, <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/solana-labs\/gulf-stream-solanas-mempool-less-transaction-forwarding-protocol-d342e72186ad\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">they replaced mempool with a faster alternative<\/a> and they even came up with <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/solana-labs\/tower-bft-solanas-high-performance-implementation-of-pbft-464725911e79\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a novelty consensus approach<\/a> which is designed for speed. All these things combined, they are <a href=\"https:\/\/break.solana.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bragging about supporting 50,000 tps<\/a>. Based on my quick research no one seems to contest this statement, so it\u2019ll probably be roughly correct. After all, <a href=\"https:\/\/projectserum.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">project Serum<\/a> is an order book-based (read: extremely transaction heavy) exchange that\u2019s already operating on top of Solana.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another example: Binance launched its version of an Ethereum-compatible smart-contract chain called Binance Smart Chain. While not even properly decentralized, people flock to it. The reason? It works now, for a fraction of the cost.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me end with a prediction: by the end of 2021 people will be fed up by sharding solutions not progressing fast enough and new vertical-scaling solutions will emerge. Solana and Binance Smart Chain will attract even more attention and so will non-sharding scaling solutions on Ethereum such as <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.ethhub.io\/ethereum-roadmap\/layer-2-scaling\/optimistic_rollups\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Rollups<\/a>. Sure, these may be a temporary solution, but sometimes <a href=\"https:\/\/www.quoteopia.com\/quote.php?quote=301091\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">nothing is more permanent than a temporary solution.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Vacuumlabs we are conservative about the choice of technologies. Using overhyped stuff often leads to pain, misery, and weekend overtimes, and no one needs that. But to innovate, sometimes you need to mindfully bet on something new and promising. That\u2019s what we did with <a href=\"https:\/\/adalite.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Cardano<\/a> years ago, and we\u2019re doing with Solana now.<br><strong>If you\u2019re interested in developing for these platforms, <a href=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/jobs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">we\u2019re hiring<\/a>!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Disclaimer: The article is not investment advice.

When Vacuumlabs was founded, we benefited tremendously from the ecosystem and supportive network we had around us. To best capture opportunities, both startups and corporates need access to strategic guidance, legal professionals, a secure environment to test and experiment, an introduction to partners, and so much more. In that spirit, we have now forged an official partnership with both the Slovak Fintech Association and Mastercard to create the very first<\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fintechhub.sk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong> FinTech Hub Slovakia<\/strong><\/a><strong>. In fact, qualifying businesses can already apply today, to become a member and join our ranks.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a company with a well-established track record in supporting brands that accelerate change in global financial services and make up this ecosystem, we did not hesitate to forge a partnership with the Slovak Fintech Association and Mastercard, and get the Fintech Hub Slovakia off the ground. Based in Bratislava, this is the first FinTech Hub designed to support innovation within the CEE region and demonstrates the serious intention of all partners to build Slovakia into the next global leader in financial technology.<br><br>The Hub was launched in December 2020, and is now fully operational. Inspired by the successful regulatory sandboxes in countries like Great Britain and Singapore, we are in the comfortable position to choose the best of similarly functioning platforms, and combine them under one roof. We approached the Hub from a vision of openness and accessibility. Because of that, the application process is now open and we would love to encourage you to join us in bolstering the level of digital finance innovation in Slovakia and across this region.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our overarching goal is to support innovation and digitization in the financial sector in the CEE region. The Hub is looking to bring companies the opportunity to test the validity of their solutions in a secure environment. All the resources needed can be provided, along with expert help and advice. Furthermore, the Hub can provide much-needed support to help members obtain the necessary licenses in the sector.<br><br>One of the most interesting and sought-after benefits of the Hub, is the location in Slovakia itself. As Matej Ft\u00e1\u010dnik, CXO of Vacuumlabs, explains: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>&#8220;We are members of the European Union, as well as the North Atlantic Alliance.

                                 \n\t\t\n\t<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Full transcript of this episode is available&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/blog\/podcasts\/travers-clarke-walker-full-transcript-of-the-podcast\">here.<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing should be clear: executing a digital transformation within a bank is incredibly hard. A complete transformation involves much more than just apps and online banking platforms: besides the fact that the product needs to be digital-first, <em>everything else<\/em> also needs to be accessible digitally. Indeed, the whole experience needs to be adapted. The goal is always to move away from one-size-fits-all generic banking products towards personalization and increasingly tailored offerings. But to achieve all that while retaining a sense of operational flexibility and cost-effectiveness is a true challenge indeed.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our \u2018Banking on Air\u2019 podcast, host Helene Panzarino welcomed Travers Clarke-Walker from Thought Machine, a UK-based core banking company. Travers knows the intricacies of these digital transformation challenges like few others. Not only does the product need to transform, but also the organisation&#8217;s challenges and a multitude of regulatory requirements need to be considered. It all plays together. Progress in technology now makes innovation and expansion much easier, and increasingly opens new options to deal with local regulatory challenges and other obstacles. As Travers explains on the podcast:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cIf you were trying to build a bank in New York, Hong Kong or London, and you&#8217;re choosing the right technology, then arguably you can build the same bank in each of those markets, adhere to local regulatory requirements, meet that state or federal obligations and then relaunch the same bank in other markets. There may be some local variations in those markets, but flexibly and a modernly architected application allows you to make those modifications without an enormous degree of cost or time being the problem.\u201d &#8211; Travers Clarke-Walker<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>To offer truly modern experiences, flexibility is essential. That flexibility is achieved, in part, through the right choice of technology. Where previously banks were designed to offer generic products to the masses, they find themselves under increasing pressure to offer a tailored solution to each customer segment. And through modern technology, those options are available to every bank. That\u2019s where core banking engines come in: they enable banks to innovate on a modern tech stack and work at the speed of innovation. The more adaptive and flexible the underlying infrastructure, the easier it is for banks to ship new product experiences to customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But technology is not the only piece. Flexibility needs to be sought in all areas of operations, ranging from product and technology to organizational structuring and smart partnerships. Travers explains:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cThe relationship is much more than just providing the technology. It&#8217;s also having an organization that is fit to contract with a bank and then identifying if you like the coalition of partners who are also fit to work with the bank. But the absolute point in there is a collaboration of partners working together as seamlessly as they can to build an entirely new technology stack \u201d&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8211; Travers Clarke-Walker<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>For some banks, there can be blockers in the forms of existing vendor licenses that bring old technology that strangles and hinders further innovation. But according to Travers, banks shouldn\u2019t hesitate when it comes to executing their digital transformation:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cStarting is more important than thinking. And if you&#8217;re doing a new stack without the purpose of full bank transformation, then that&#8217;s probably a mistake. And if you&#8217;re not doing one and you&#8217;re still considering it, then that is also probably a mistake.\u201d &#8211; Travers Clarke-Walker<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The moment is there, the technology is ready for it, and most banks should jump in with both feet. The cloud is the future, and even in an industry like banking, that future is approaching quickly. It is true that digital transformation in the banking industry has taken longer to gain momentum than it did in other industries like media or retail, but it is now proven also in banking that moving to the cloud significantly cuts costs and has the potential to transform the customer experiences.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Travers, there is a big difference between banks that already adopted cloud infrastructure and those who didn\u2019t. He explains that the cloud as an infrastructure choice for business has proven itself again and again, and banking is now ready to make the switch.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cI think we can be respectful of the delay. I don&#8217;t think we can be respectful of now not moving though. I think that this is the point of change.\u201d &#8211; Travers Clarke-Walker<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>To find out more about digital transformation and what banks should think about before doing it, listen to our new Banking on Air podcast episode featuring Travers Clarke-Walker from Though Machine \u2013 Available on<a href=\"https:\/\/podcasts.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/inside-the-vacuum\/id1505101625?ign-mpt=uo%3D4\"> <strong>Apple Podcasts<\/strong><\/a>,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.breaker.audio\/inside-the-vacuum\"> <strong>Breaker<\/strong><\/a>,<a href=\"https:\/\/podcasts.google.com\/?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy8xODhkNTE2OC9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw%3D%3D\"> <strong>Google Podcasts<\/strong><\/a>,<a href=\"https:\/\/overcast.fm\/itunes1505101625\/inside-the-vacuum\"> <strong>Overcast<\/strong><\/a>,<a href=\"https:\/\/pca.st\/jdvlp9mq\"> <strong>Pocket Casts<\/strong><\/a>,<a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/show\/2wKh1nEPsvZfJc8nZFBFah\"> <strong>Spotify<\/strong><\/a> or here:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"post__player player\"><iframe border=\"0\" class=\"player__iframe\" src=\"https:\/\/anchor.fm\/insidethevacuum\/embed\/episodes\/28-True-digital-transformation-with-Travers-Clarke-Walker-Thought-Machine-et9uj3\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" scrolling=\"no\" frameBorder=\"0\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n\n\n\t\n\t<div id=\"podcast-subscribe-button-3988\" class=\"secondline-psb-radius-style\">\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n<div class=\"secondline-psb-subscribe-icons\" style=\"margin-top:-2em;margin-bottom:1em;\"><strong>WHERE TO LISTEN<\/strong> &nbsp;

And I&#8217;m your host for this episode of vacuum labs, where a solution-based tech powerhouse. And we believe that the future is in communities when it comes to digital transformation and financial services. If you&#8217;re interested in hearing more about FinTech, digital banking or payments, please don&#8217;t hesitate to subscribe or to attend one of our virtual events. And today I&#8217;m going to be joined by Travers Clarke-Walker, who is the Chief Commercial Officer of Thought Machine. Before we get into the meat of the matter, I would just like to say that recently Vacuumlabs and Thought Machine announced a partnership after the successful implementation of Vault in Hong Kong, which is also another reason we&#8217;re very happy to have Travers with us today. Previously we also had the pleasure of hosting Paul Taylor, the CEO of Thought Machine on a podcast with my colleague, Marcel Klimo who also spoke with Mark Warrick about Cauldron, the creative lab of Thought Machines. Lots of information, and very interesting topic and chat from Thought Machine. If you missed it, I encourage you to go back over the old podcast episodes because I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re going to learn and be thoroughly enjoyed and entertained is the word I&#8217;m looking for. Because I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re going to learn a lot and find them very entertaining and enjoyable. Onto today&#8217;s podcast with Travers, Travers welcome.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Travers Clarke-Walker: <\/strong>[00:01:30] <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you very much.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:01:31] <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lovely to have you. You and I are going to dig a little bit deeper into legacy core banking systems converting, moving to the cloud. Is it different in different parts of the world or is it really something that should be the tech should enable us to just transport and deal with the regulatory environment elsewhere cultural environment elsewhere? Really important because right now the upsurge in digital banking obviously spurred on by COVID has just been off the charts. Customers are changing the way they bank. The banks themselves are having to adjust to the way that we bank. And if you weren&#8217;t digital before COVID kicked in, you definitely are going to have to go there now. If you were, you need to accelerate it, but as with so many things, and I think we&#8217;ve talked about this before. Traditionally incumbents, in my experience have been resistant to the cloud for reasons around security or not really understanding the difference between versions of the cloud. They can&#8217;t really appreciate the cost efficiencies so on. And I think in the last couple of years, we&#8217;ve seen this changing. I certainly know my experience from 2017 until now there&#8217;s been a big change. Maybe we can also unpack what does the right core look like and what is involved in either migrating or starting a fresh in the clouds. Okay. Let&#8217;s start with what factors need to be considered and all factors, resources, competition, constraints,regulatory constraints for example, if you&#8217;re thinking of a weighing up moving to the cloud?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Travers Clarke-Walker: <\/strong>[00:03:03] <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. Wow. What an amazing introduction in terms of the transition point, the inflection point that we&#8217;re having as an industry at large. One of the things to weigh up in terms of a transition to the cloud at your point in introduction that the world has moved on a lot. COVID has in some respects, been an accelerator of that. But truth be known all the banks in the world have been going through some version of digital transformation journey over the last decade. And a lot of that has been at if you like the frontend of the experience. I guess what banks tend to call the channels, which has been the apps and it&#8217;s been the online banking. But true digital transformation goes much deeper than that and expensive digital transformation also has to take into account cloud migration to your point. What are the things to weigh up? I guess first and foremost amongs, those you perhaps expect me to say it from a Thought Machine perspective is choosing technology that is born of the clouds generation as well. And that means truly cloud native architecture, microservices, containerized deployed through Cobblerneties. Ideally cloud agnostic so that you can see on any of the cloud service providers. The choice of the technology that you&#8217;re putting in the cloud is as important as if you like the psychology position or if your intent to move to the cloud. There is a world of difference between moving a previous generation of technology onto cloud infrastructure. Frankly, what we&#8217;re doing is moving the applications from one set of boxes, to another set of boxes and changing who&#8217;s taking accountability and responsibility for them as opposed to taking full benefits of what cloud provides is that infrastructure tool for the business. So that&#8217;s the first. The second is the organizational competency. There is a competency requirement in terms of addressing cloud infrastructure. That&#8217;s understanding what&#8217;s available from the vendors, understanding how you&#8217;re going to build your technology stack. Having people within the organization have the competency to manage those technology stacks, so there is a competency play that needs to be brought in and checking and balancing within the bank that you have those competencies. And if you can&#8217;t, where can you buy them in from. So can the vendors in the context of us as Thought Machine can we bring that? Can Vacuumlabs, bring it as a competency set in terms of being able to provide support and wrap around services? And can you buy it in internally, either through recruitment and or through development and training of the existing IT and technology functions? The competency that the business exhibit. So that would perhaps be the second. And the third is the regulatory environment. What is the appetite? Has the regulator in your area recognized the benefits of cloud infrastructure? If they have, what are they saying in terms of the contractual relationships you need to have, the relationships with vendors and with the cloud infrastructure providers themselves. And if they haven&#8217;t, what needs to be done to enable a local environment regulatory and legal, that satisfactorily means that you can migrate to the cloud. So I think that kind of three areas, perhaps. Technology, competency and regulatory and legal environments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:06:08] <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wonderfull. As you were talking, I was thinking about the US with a complex regulatory environment with what has been, let&#8217;s say a more fragmented and large. Obviously a banking and finance sector from the large banks down to the smaller banks. We have literally tens of thousands of banks are floating around and state by state obviously makes the federal versus the state requirements different. As opposed to the UK where we have few regulators, one or two regulators that are involved in this. And then again, when we go back to someplace like Hong Kong, we&#8217;ve had the experience of working together where they&#8217;re just starting to issue for example, virtual licenses. The regulatory environment is very different. And yet I think that we can avoid, if we&#8217;re going to do this efficiently, cost efficiently respond to what&#8217;s happened over the last year to retain,a customers and do that efficiently, we need to do it as a global, if you&#8217;d like taking the technology, importing it globally. But is that difficult?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Travers Clarke-Walker: <\/strong>[00:07:03] <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think,&nbsp; again, this probably comes to a point around what technology you&#8217;re looking to deploy. Completely modernly architected applications. And if I put it in the context of our core banking system, to some extent it is regulatory agnostic. It is designed for you to be able to build products and services that can marry up to any regulatory regime. We use smart contracts as a process of building the bank grade product. So our current account mortgage alone are built as a small contract and all that really means is that independent and orchestrated away from the Kernel.&nbsp; That means that you&#8217;ve got flexibility and manufacturing. Now, traditional systems haven&#8217;t had that. So traditional core banking systems have had the products kind of hard coded within them. If you like the kind of closed box versus open box style modules. To your point, if you were trying to build a bank in New York or build a bank in Hong Kong or go to the bank in London, if you&#8217;re choosing the right technology, then arguably you can build the same bank in each of those markets, adhere to local regulatory, be that state or federal obligations and then relaunch the same bank in other markets. Now, there may be some local variations in those but flexibly and modernly architected application allows you to make those modifications without an enormous degree of cost or time being the problem, which is traditionally what has been the case with previous generation, of course. In many regards, it comes back to the same point, which is the right choice of technology allows flexibility of where and how you can deploy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:08:32] <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Truly interesting, because I think people assume that you couldn&#8217;t do that, that it had to be very specific. And I&#8217;m sure that there&#8217;s a little bit of a lack of understanding fully about the technology and how that will then be deployed. And as you were talking about core, I was thinking about people being bound by 5 or 10 year contracts with certain core providers, who rarely do I hear somebody say my current core provider is amazing and wish that they would work with more FinTechs and then you wind up having almost like an additional layer of platform layer between the FinTech world and the core provider world, because neither of them are able to work efficiently or sufficiently, and it just gets more complex and more expensive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Travers Clarke-Walker: <\/strong>[00:09:12] <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was kind of interesting points in there. First to which of course is that people don&#8217;t say their core banking providers are amazing. We&#8217;re here to change that. Our mission is that of course, people can turn around and say, well, my core banking providers are amazing. So let&#8217;s start out without, that as our objective, as an organization and we are here to transform the industry and that translation agenda is one that&#8217;s deep seated in the organization. We built the technology from the ground up for this generation of users, for this generation of technology, infrastructure capabilities and to serve the future set of product requirements. We&#8217;ve been very static in what types of products banks have been able to produce as well. And there should be more flexibility in the types of products. The way we&#8217;ve architected it allows for all of that. So in that regard, we should be able to amaze customers, both our banking client customer, but the banks be able to amaze their customers as well. Your point on the five-year kind of lock-in, what I&#8217;ve got this contract with this vendor for a period of time. I mean, to some extent, we also have to recognize that transformation programs are quite long and big programs in Nove???, right. And even if you have got two or three or five years left on existing vendor relationships, I would argue, that&#8217;s not a point not to start. It&#8217;s in fact a reason to start because you will want to validate a wider technology stack, you will want to integrate other FinTech parties and you will want to potentially redesign products and services and offerings and your operations model and so on. There are large programs and actually the majority of our customers around the world are doing some form of transformation program that has started as some version of a digital greenfield, that might be a small migration of a book of business into a digital greenfield bank. It might be the case of building a brand new bank sometimes under a new brand. There is a development cycle of the transformation. It&#8217;s building the new technology stack, it&#8217;s placing a cohort of business on it, which means we recognize that of course calls, are going to have to live side by side for a period of time. We and Vacuumlabs&nbsp;&nbsp; have experience in how that can be created and done. I guess the short version is even if you&#8217;ve got five years left to run on our existing vendor license, that in itself is not a reason not to make a start on your transformation program.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:11:32] <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think if people don&#8217;t hear anything else besides that from this podcast, you&#8217;ve done your job, because I think we need to get people not looking for excuses, but finding ways to enable. For me, that&#8217;s like music to my ears. I wanted to go back and touch on the vendor selection as it were, or vendor partnerships as well. I mentioned chorus partnering with FinTechs. We talked about you partnering with a Vacuumlabs. How do you choose a vendor to work with and what makes a good partnership?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Travers Clarke-Walker: <\/strong>[00:11:57] <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, so the only thing I would say is that it is a team sport. A core banking system is not a bank, a side provider isn&#8217;t a manufacturer or bank either or a banks technology provider. It is a collaboration environment, in that regard it&#8217;s a team sport. I think the first part of the answer is generational alignment. If you are looking to build a new technology stack, you need to populate it with technologies that are of the same generation, which means if you&#8217;re wrapping around a core banking system, you still need fraud and risk analytic tools. You&#8217;d still need KYC. You still need onboarding journeys. You still need digital frontends. By far and away, the easiest way is API integrations with one another, where they&#8217;re all from the same generation. That massively accelerates. The one thing that I&#8217;ve regularly said, and it&#8217;s a bit of a quarter, I guess, to the FinTech industry is great technology doesn&#8217;t necessarily lead you to a bank buying. There is a load of other stuff that the FinTech industry has to do actually, which is getting the organization fit to contract with a bank. And that is as much of understanding the legal requirements that a bank will have, or have a requirement for, the backdrop of the regulatory environment that you&#8217;re effectively subscribing up to as a result of working with the bank, showing the internal governance and control and policy frameworks, and so on. So actually the relationship is much more than just providing for the technology. It&#8217;s also having an organization that is fit. to&nbsp; contract with a bank and then identifying if you like the coalition of partners who are also fit to work with the bank. So it is that combination of all of those parts. But the absolute point in there, it is a collaboration of partners working together as seamlessly as they can to build an entirely new technology stack and we&#8217;ve partnered up. We have other partners. I won&#8217;t sit here and run a promotion for each of them, but we have quite a range of partners and they range from that kind of strap house advisory style services to the SI and integration providers through to the FinTech community at large as vendors. It is a case of working with all of those quite often under the banks selection process. The one thing I would say that would be wrong for us is this part of the industry is for us to impose our views of what the right partners are. We can facilitate our views as to the types of partners we&#8217;ve got around. If a bank has to take, all the banks, have to build a capability to identify those partners by selection and assessment themselfs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:14:21] <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a good point and I do wonder sometimes, especially if it&#8217;s unfamiliar territory or if there&#8217;s a lot at stake, it, depending on the size of the bank and the person making the decision, that they haven&#8217;t got those skills. And so there is a responsibility on us as an industry to educate people as to how, what good looks like. I agree with that. And in our cases, I mean as it happens, we have an office in Hong Kong. We did some work together in Hong Kong. We&#8217;re in the UK. We&#8217;re in Europe. We have an office in the US. So we&#8217;re finding ourselves in similar places. And I think in the US now in the last, let&#8217;s say, I don&#8217;t know, a couple of years, we&#8217;ve seen the OCC and the FDIC. The FDIC, particularly on the yellow and the McWilliams wants to have a list of Fintechs that have been approved or vetted, curated. The same way that we have the FCA here, for example, that will say, yeah, these fintechs have been approved by us and they&#8217;re good to go. And I think that gives confidence to the industry or saves time, saves money, but also says, yeah, they&#8217;ve done it, they&#8217;re okay. They&#8217;ve been through some sort of process making it easier to decide who might be in that group to pick and choose from. Slowly, I guess it&#8217;s happening around the world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Travers Clarke-Walker: <\/strong>[00:15:23] <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is and we have seen quite progressive behaviors from a number of regulators around innovation hubs and sandpits and those types of things. We&#8217;ve also seen very proactive behavior from banks taking the fintechs into the regulators and saying, we&#8217;ve done the necessary assessments. We have looked as they, this technology as if it were our own and validated it accordingly.&nbsp; The combination of those things is regulators are getting to a point of saying I&#8217;ve seen this deployed, or I&#8217;m satisfied that this bank has done the necessary assessments. I don&#8217;t know whether or not it&#8217;s a formalized list of approved Fintechs in the context of UK regulation. There is no such thing as an approved vendor, because of course it&#8217;s the bank&#8217;s responsibility. But I think what we do have is a confidence level being built up. It&#8217;s incumbent on all of us to play our part in the development of that confidence level within regulators.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:16:17] <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I agree with you and I think we should take that responsibility on this industry. I want to deviate a little bit because your background is really interesting. You&#8217;ve gone through not just the banking and finance as an industry obviously. You&#8217;ve worked in other industries before. Energy for example, and other places. Do you see parallels in anything that can be learned or that can be transferred from one industry into banking and finance in this space?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Travers Clarke-Walker: <\/strong>[00:16:39] <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I do, you&#8217;re right. I have very diverse background retail into energy, into financial services and then into financial services technology, I guess. There are always cross learnings between industries. I think the most pertinent one at the moment for banking and financial services and the technology provision and financial services is the proof of cloud. We said at the beginning, we&#8217;re at that transition point. But we&#8217;re at a transition point for a technology type that has been proven in other industries and whether or not we look at it through media or retail, those industries have been using cloud infrastructure, enterprise grade scale for well over a decade. And yes, in some respects, some of it was born in those industries or certainly close proximity to those industries. But what it does mean is that you can look across and go, okay, this has dramatically changed the cost ratios and then banking context starts to cost income ratio. It&#8217;s transformed the customer experiences that have been able to be created and in many regards it has seeing the fortunes of businesses that did adopt and didn&#8217;t adopt go respectively in those directions. And those that did adopt to the very successful in large players and those that didn&#8217;t in some regards no longer with us at all. So I think that point of transition and the proof of cloud as an infrastructure choice for business transformation is now done. It&#8217;s been done in other industries, but that is something to look at and go, yes, we are absolutely at that point. Perhaps, that&#8217;s the regulatory point. Perhaps the thing that we needed was for the regulators also to get to, yes,&nbsp; it is now a proven technology that we can rely upon in the financial services industry. The one big learn is we&#8217;re talking about a transformation on proven technology and proven application types and proven software development methodologies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:18:32] <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you mentioned the regulator, I was thinking about someone saying to me, they went to the PRA in the UK where you go through your feedback when you&#8217;re looking for a banking license and they said, so where&#8217;s the data stored and they sat in the cloud and they said, where in the cloud and they said, we don&#8217;t know. As opposed to, well, there&#8217;s five rooms of mainframe somewhere that we can point you in the direction of. And the regulator looking at them like you don&#8217;t know? This is a few years ago.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Travers Clarke-Walker: <\/strong>[00:18:55] <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. I was going to say, now I think we have better answers in that we do know exactly where it is within the cloud and we can manage where it is within the cloud. It gives you choices in terms of how federated that might be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:19:05] <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, kudos to the regulators, they&#8217;ve moved pretty quickly into recognizing this. The other point that you brought up is the customer centric point and of course, in other industries, be they music or fashion at the customer centric position was there in the beginning. Whereas somehow in banking and financial services, we took longer to get there somehow. I suppose, built on products and services with margins and targets that work inside out in their view, as opposed to outside in. So is customer centricity the thing that really would have pushed it over the edge?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Travers Clarke-Walker: <\/strong>[00:19:37] <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps. If you&#8217;re asking, why has it been a slow adoption, I think we also have to recognize that banking, it&#8217;s a risk business. It is in many respects, risky in terms of the provision of the products and services. It is critical infrastructure in many regards as well. And I don&#8217;t think you play with critical infrastructure without proven points of validation of the technologies that you&#8217;re choosing. I think we can be respectful of the delay. I don&#8217;t think we can be respectful of now not moving though. I think that this is the point of change. I&#8217;m not talking about the digitalization of front-end. We&#8217;d all recognize that&#8217;s already happened. If there&#8217;s actually none of us that don&#8217;t use some version of digital banking and even if you don&#8217;t use digital banking, actually a lot of what you&#8217;re presented within a branch network for instance, is actually relying upon the digital frontends that have been created. You just don&#8217;t really observe that. Transformation has happened, but only at the top end, shall we say of the systems. So this is the full digital transformation. It has to be done in a safe and secure way. The technologies have to be proven. We&#8217;ve repeated a few times that we&#8217;ve now reached that point where they are and they&#8217;re accessible and the FinTech community at large has pretty much sold for all of the component parts of banking. If you look around, we&#8217;ve talked that the regulators have also become accepting of it. I think the bits that kind of really push now for why the change, it&#8217;s what else you can do with it. Because it&#8217;s not that you necessarily would just repeat a design of what a bank currently looks like. It&#8217;s what you can do in new experiences. Real time data that allows you to develop different frameworks for risk appetite, different frameworks for fraud monitoring, different frameworks for analysis and insights on product offerings. It also allows you to develop entirely new product. Products have tended to be pretty standardized in terms of interest rate calculations or propensity of payment or any of those types things. But that&#8217;s because they were difficult to manufacture in the system. So once you&#8217;ve manufactured it, you didn&#8217;t really want to change it too much. There&#8217;s a complexity in doing that. Flexible systems, obviously context for this is Vault and smart contracts, allow you to kind of almost rip up the rule book to some of those things. So, I can experiment with new products, I can design new interpretations of these things. And at low cost of doing that, creating better experiences and having the propensity to delight customers. You referenced Mark and Paul have been on previous podcasts. In Mark&#8217;s piece he will have done a Cauldron part of our business, which is kind of our development lab if you like. That allows you to kind of manufacture all sorts of new products and services. They favor all sorts of different interpretations as to financial instruments. The fact that those things are possible now mean that banks can create new engaging relationships propositions that just were not possible for. They were just extremely costly. Therefore, the reason to do them was quite often offset by the difficulty and complexity and cost, meaning they&#8217;d never gained to market.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:22:37] <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s interesting. You say that because there&#8217;s always been that criticism of monolith versus micro and all the new challenges in the neos that came onto the market saying, we can do this because we&#8217;re agile, we&#8217;re built on a very low cost platform and we&#8217;re all plugged in through&nbsp; APIs. There is a cost implication there, and if you&#8217;re not there in the first place, you&#8217;re probably not going to do it and bring it to life. So there may have been a desire, but if the technology wasn&#8217;t there, then it makes it that much more difficult. Is it different for a very large bank, do you think than it is for lets say that a tier two or tier three bank in this environment as well, because the large bank probably has a bigger IT department, bigger spending budgets, a bigger customer base, maybe more of a need and an ability to run them sort of side by side while they&#8217;re transitional for their old core?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Travers Clarke-Walker: <\/strong>[00:23:19] <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are definitely differences. I think you can argue that the larger bank probably has a more complex set of systems, but I think you can also argue that it has a cost ratio that it&#8217;s spending at the moment that can be more readily redeployed. It has a breadth of technologists. That means that it can probably more easily stand up competency. That&#8217;s not exclusively the case of course, but I think you can go, okay, fine. That scale it&#8217;s more complex, but they probably have more people and they have more budgetary reallocation that can be applied to it and proceed to an outcome. On the other hand, if you take the mid tear that slightly less complex IT infrastructure. Probably serves to an easier transformation journey and that may be offset by the fact that there isn&#8217;t that such a requirement for a breadth of competency in order to do that and as we&#8217;ve said before, the industry in support in terms of FinTech and the partners in the FinTech system are also building competency to assist these banks. You can buy in the necessary competencies and you may be dealing with a slightly less complex set of infrastructure to change in the first place. So I think to some extent, yes, they are different and they&#8217;re probably different in terms of the timelines of the programs, but neither is a reason for not progressing forward.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:24:35] <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No and I think over the past year, we&#8217;ve seen lots of examples of 60 in the large banks and exit from the US as well, where they definitely do need to move. The customer does very much need to come first and I think you could be complacent for a long time because you had cash reserves or you had millions and millions of customers. You could sit back, you could watch this whole thing play out in front of you, but I think the last year was one of those defining moments in banking and finance, where we say, okay, this is it. Everyone had to become digital because we couldn&#8217;t go anywhere else. Whether your demographic is 70 plus or it&#8217;s 20, everybody had to go digital<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Travers Clarke-Walker: <\/strong>[00:25:07] <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There can be no excuse for&nbsp; not taking the opportunity to lower the cost base of an industry. Whatever industry that is, if the opportunity is there irrespective of cash reserves. As far back as thinkers, 2018, Mark Carney at the time, Governor of Bank of England were saying there was 30 plus percent reduction in costs if cloud infrastructure were deployed into banks and up to similar numbers in terms of things like fraud detection rates and so on. The technology enables lower cost base, real time data flows. They enhance both cost reduction but also customer experiences as we&#8217;ve said. We haven&#8217;t talked that much about the end customer, but the opportunity for the customer to have better experience is whether or not that&#8217;s richer onboarding journeys, whether or not that&#8217;s better insight about their financial behavior or better designed products. And what I mean by depth better design products is products that are more directly relevant to them. In a borrowing scenario, borrowing in such a way that it&#8217;s directly relevant to your income streams and the management of income and so on. You know, have one of our banks building out a propositions for what they call solopreneurs, so individual contractor types. Who we know have bumpy income streams, and they look different and we know that there&#8217;s arranging from the gig economy upwards. We know that there&#8217;s a changeing working patterns and working behaviors. But bank products have not tended to be designed to take into account the local constitution of the individual, but that now is possible. Lower costs, richer experience, by the experiential level of an onboarding or a transaction experience and rich products are all within the grasp of the industry. That can be no excuses for anybody not to pursue that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:26:50] <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, exactly. It&#8217;s the pencil movement is ideal. It&#8217;s lowering your costs, but getting more money and then making your customer happy, stay longer, better lifetime value.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Travers Clarke-Walker: <\/strong>[00:26:58] <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clearly, the risk of somebody else doing that instead of you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:27:01] <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be that a FinTech or a nonfinancial institution, and many of them are making a lot of noise at the moment as well. And I think behind that, some of the things that you&#8217;ve talked about, I was drawn to open banking, obviously of PSD2 open banking, we&#8217;re seeing that now spread around the world where I can share my data as a customer and then you have that two way traffic in terms of the extracting the intelligence from my data, but it&#8217;s also shared, and you can offer me something more hyper-personalized to me, which is what I want and what, in our case, in the UK, the CMA mandated for, but we&#8217;re seeing that around the world voluntarily or otherwise.&nbsp; Listening to the journey you think you&#8217;d ask yourself, why would somebody not see this now? It does feel to me you&#8217;re obviously more in the thick of it, but it feels to me on the periphery that there is a groundswell and that everybody is a bit more accepting now everyone&#8217;s understood this and that the last year just kind of moved it along and accelerated a bit?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Travers Clarke-Walker: <\/strong>[00:27:52] <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anybody isn&#8217;t thinking about doing it. I of course may live in an echo chamber as well because anybody who talks to us is clearly thinking about doing it. But I suspect there are no banks, financial institutions that are not thinking about doing it. And haven&#8217;t already started in some respects on that journey. I also think it can potentially be quite daunting and challenging. If you just look at the FinTech industry at large and how much information we consume from different FinTechs and the stories and the business models that are building up the time, there is just an enormous amount of information out there and whether or not you&#8217;ve got a formal kind of market scouting function, that&#8217;s out there looking for the next generation of technologies or whether or not you&#8217;re just trying to read and keep up to date with all the blogs. There is an enormous amount of transformation going on and that&#8217;s complimented with a lot of commentary and a lot of information and a lot of people saying they know what the answer is. I spent 10 years in the bank and one of the things I did find quite daunting was kind of the well okay which of these things do we choose? How do we make a decision about which direction. For this part of the journey I would say starting is more important than thinking. I&#8217;ve said in earlier on in the podcast, we are seeing a material move to the creation of a digital Greenfield bank and what you put in it, whether or not that&#8217;s an orphaned book of business or a back book of business or a new brand, to some extent, those choices don&#8217;t matter as much of the principle of building a new digital Greenfield stack. Then identifying what you put in it to some extent may be a result of what&#8217;s your most engaging business model internally. If you&#8217;ve got something that&#8217;s sitting on a very expensive cost base that you think you can move, then that&#8217;s an advantage for that bank. If on the other hand, you&#8217;re looking for a market entry under a new banking license has been awarded somewhere in the world and you can do that under a new stack, then that&#8217;s your business case for doing it. Each of those business cases is different, but they&#8217;re all built on the same foundation, which is a new stack. And they&#8217;re all built on the foundation of that new stack. Long-term purpose should be for the full bank transformation. If you&#8217;re doing a new stack without the purpose of full bank transformation, then that&#8217;s probably a mistake. And if you&#8217;re not doing one and you&#8217;re still considering it, then that is also probably a mistake.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:30:07] <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Very interesting and I suppose then that goes back to having the buy in from the top down and from the bottom up, because your plan needs to be going in that direction. You need everyone behind it. And I think you&#8217;ve very succinctly addressed that the technology and the fact that we need to be aware of what the technologies are and educate our community as to what that is, but realize that it is portable regulations aside and some other local flavors aside, that we need to build up the competency within our organizations. And we as an industry and banks also have a responsibility to work on that together. Needs to be able to make the right choices in the right vendor that fits each of the different situations and have vendors that have robust governance and that can meet the regulatory requirements, so everyone can also relax about that. And that it&#8217;s most important to actually just get started and not stay in that. Whenever I talk about having too much choice, I&#8217;ve always take myself back to the US. When I go home, I stand in the salad dressing aisle of a supermarket and you look down that aisle and you see low fat, pepper, chili, blah, blah, next one, over high fat ranch. And when I get to the whole aisle, I always wind up with oil and vinegar and some salt and pepper. Because too much choice without having any knowledge in a way that speaks to me and I can digest either these paralysis or doing what you&#8217;ve always done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Travers Clarke-Walker: <\/strong>[00:31:29] <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:31:30] <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is up to us also to help people to avoid that paralysis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Travers Clarke-Walker: <\/strong>[00:31:33] <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is up to us to be able to signal which choices could be made, which ones work with one another, which integrations have been done and have been proven. And I said earlier on in the podcast is not for us to dictate to a bank, what technology choices they should make or what vendors they should select, but we should certainly be laying out the path of which ones we&#8217;ve seen successfully work elsewhere.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:31:56] <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that&#8217;s a wonderful place for us to say thank you very much to Travers Clark-Walker for being with us.

Joseph Schumpeter, the economist who coined the term \u201ccreative destruction,\u201d would be proud.\u201d<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The implications of his thinking were both simple and profound: in any industry, the ultimate winner would be whichever company is the best software company. Either you <em>become<\/em> the software company, or get beaten by a software-powered disruptor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nothing has been more true for our own industry. Through the rise of modern Fintech disruptors, digital challenger banks, embedded finance and super apps, banking will never be the same.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This shift extends into the various verticals within fintech, and in our recent podcast with Nikolai Hack of Nucoro, we explored the impact of and opportunities that arise from the disruptive players in wealth management. In 2013-14, most industry experts expected wealth management to quickly follow the same path as the digital banks did, and that most investment accounts would be managed in a highly automated fashion, through \u2018robo advisors\u2019 and other digital technology.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And sure enough: digital disruptors popped up around the world, deploying a variety of business models, most of which struggled to get to profitability, and the earlier projections regarding AUM and active users fell far short of expectations. Some entrants were more notable than others; most were B2C models, and many were looking to the millennial as a target group. Robinhood \u2014 by far the most high-profile brokerage app of 2021 \u2014 launched in March 2015. In that same year Monzo launched in the UK, and Amsterdam-based discount broker DeGiro expanded its offering across Europe.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prior to the launch of digital options, most consumers accessed investment products via their retail bank, brokers, or face-to-face advisors, with varying levels of success, cost and returns. The advent of tech-enabled solutions had a significant impact on these legacy providers, and alongside regulatory changes in certain jurisdictions, the historical model of investing began to fall away. As the prophecy of Marc Andreessen had foretold, the software-powered challengers came to disrupt <em>everything<\/em>, and traditional retail banks struggled to innovate on top of their decades-old legacy IT systems, resulting in a loss of market share and very tightly squeezed margins. Traditional banks were truly like the mythical Goliath: big and powerful, but ultimately held back by their size, and constrained by their legacy systems and bureaucratic complexities.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyone surveying the landscape in 2021 might conclude that the challenger wealth propositions have won the battle for market share, but not for profitability. Many of the players in the B2C Wealth space are loss-making, leaving the door open for retail banks to ramp up their efforts in this space, both digitally and via human interaction. Indeed, the strong customer relationships of a traditional retail bank have proven to be a formidable moat in the psychological battle for the mind of the retail user overall and in this vertical. In fact, could it be possible that the incumbents have a much stronger hand than appears at first glance? If this is the case, then why aren\u2019t we seeing more incumbents launching wealth offerings? In the UK, retail customers are asking their banks to offer these products and services, yet banks are <a href=\"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1057\/s41260-020-00163-4\">reluctant to respond<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Incumbents are able to partner with and license software solutions from providers like Nucoro, who make a clean tech stack available to those with willing customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This relationship completely changes the dynamics: by partnering with fintechs incumbent banks can continue to leverage their brand name and existing client relationships to funnel millions of existing users into newly created wealth management offerings.It\u2019s a win-win for everyone. If the tech becomes commoditized, then what is there left to compete on? Customer relationships and customer data. On both of these fronts, I would bet on the incumbents, even if some of the customers remain due to inertia; they still remain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>In the years to come, we might see a strong comeback by the incumbent banks. Goliath might have the edge here by partnering with disruptors.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fintech partner solutions offer incumbents an opportunity that is too good to ignore: the option to break free from the shackles of their mainframe legacy systems, and the chance to build something exciting utilising modern infrastructure.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to hear more about leveraging

Slackification of banking \u2014 customer delight as a competitive edge"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>Traditionally, banking has always been functional:&nbsp;to run a bank is hard enough, and doing so competently was a competitive edge. But that model is changing: core banking infrastructure is now available as an API, ready to be plugged in by anyone who cares to leverage it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with the infrastructure being democratized, the competitive edge is shifting: companies move up the technical stack to innovate and compete. May the best customer experience win.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We call it the <em>\u201cSlackification of Banking\u201d<\/em>, because we\u2019ve seen this disruptive trend before: in 2014, team collaboration tool Slack took the world by storm, and became the fastest company ever to reach a billion dollar valuation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What was the disruption? Well, <em>not much <\/em>actually. Slack wasn\u2019t innovating on the technological layer. Slack was just much <em>nicer<\/em>, than any other tool around. The colors were friendlier. The animations were smoother. The feedback was juicier. Everything about Slack felt easier and more fun. Even little details, like the release notes, were thoughtful and funny.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a competitive landscape where any tool can get the job done\u2026 why not pick a tool you like?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A generation before, the McDonalds Happy Meal brought a delightful experience to kids, and disrupted every parent\u2019s life. It\u2019s not that hamburgers were new, but no kid would settle for anything less than getting their Happy Meal. Similarly so for the stunning designs of Tesla, and that hand-written name on your Frappuchino.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In competitive markets, delightful experiences will pull people over. And given that banking&nbsp;infrastructure is being democratized now, why would our industry be any different?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without any further ado, let\u2019s have a look at what delightful experiences look like, and show you the clear signals we\u2019re seeing that banking is bound to follow this same path.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8212;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What does a delightful experience look like, in banking?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, any one experience will be unique, but it seems there are guidelines and principles at play here. In no particular order, consider the following:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Juicy feedback<\/strong><br>Smoother animations, richer interactions, and extra attention to detail. Because the details are the perfect place to be playful and add that subtle extra touch.<br><br><a href=\"https:\/\/up.com.au\/\">Up Banking<\/a> in Australia is at the bleeding edge of the Slackification revolution in banking.

To further educate consumers and brands about their impact and carbon footprint, Doconomy recently introduced the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.2030calculator.com\/\">2030Calculator<\/a> to leverage Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to estimate the carbon footprint of products and materials.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In providing such outspoken products and services, Doconomy takes a clear stance that easily attracts ambassadors and brand loyalists.

Can it change your behaviour for the better? Who can truly say they <em>love<\/em> their banking experience?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The evolution of retail banking has always focused on straightforward functionality, with little attention paid to emotion, or experience. That\u2019s understandable. Managing your money is largely considered a serious, adult, endeavour. An administrative task to be handled with sobriety when an adult enters the working world.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet here we see an incredible opportunity \u2013&nbsp; banking, entertainment and education need not be mutually exclusive. There\u2019s plenty of room to bring the best of modern gaming, design and education into the world of finance. And there\u2019s already one player doing just that, bringing unforgettable banking experiences to the market.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meet<a href=\"https:\/\/cauldron.co\/\"> Cauldron<\/a>. It\u2019s the creative laboratory of UK-based core banking company,<a href=\"https:\/\/thoughtmachine.net\/\"> Thought Machine<\/a>. <a href=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/partnering-to-transform-banking-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Vacuumlabs recently partnered with Thought Machine<\/a> to complete the first-ever Asian installation of Thought Machine\u2019s cloud native core banking engine<a href=\"https:\/\/thoughtmachine.net\/vault\"> Vault<\/a>. This significant build enabled a new virtual bank \u2013 along with Asia\u2019s first numberless payment card \u2013 to go live from inception in just 18 months.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cauldron team designs new creative apps and products that harness some of the magic of Thought Machine\u2019s Vault. And just a short while ago we were delighted to welcome Mark Warrick, Cauldron\u2019s Managing Director, as a guest on our \u2018<a href=\"https:\/\/anchor.fm\/insidethevacuum\">Banking on Air\u2019<\/a> podcast. Mark walked us through why, until recently, the fintech world chose to steer well clear of creative design and gaming features for banking apps. But Cauldron has now developed some very exciting new game and character-based apps for the digital banking scene. So what\u2019s Cauldron\u2019s game plan?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Bringing art into banking<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cOur job is to look at what consumers might want out of a core banking engine in the future and make sure our engine can deliver that. Be it meaningful personalisation for loans, or creating a full game world for a savings app. So that&#8217;s our job. We&#8217;re totally dedicated to that singular mission.\u201d &#8211; Mark Warrick<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>There were already some glimpses of creative design peeping through challenger banks but, by and large, digital banking is somewhat behind the curve in the use of art and gamification approaches to secure market share. There\u2019s also the question of superapps: multiple banking products wrapped into one interface. A single app where users can manage their lives, financial or otherwise. Do they inherently limit creativity?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mark reckons that the snag with superapps is that while they bring benefits in the form of consolidation and integration \u2013&nbsp;their \u2018sparking joy\u2019 quotient ranks near the bottom end of the scale.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>True personalisation is the name of the game<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What products does Cauldron have up its sleeves? The company is bringing a focus on true personalisation and gamification into banking apps \u2013 specifically an emphasis on creating entire game worlds with engaging characters rather than gamification as \u2018merely the mechanism\u2019. Cauldron is shying away from the cookie-cutter approach reflected by the superapps. Its products treat banking app users to some welcome escapism while managing their finances or offering financial education. Cauldron\u2019s portfolio includes:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/nestlings.io\/\"><strong>Nestlings<\/strong><\/a>: a beta-stage<strong> <\/strong>app that introduces a cast of fantasy creatures into personal savings. \u2018<a href=\"https:\/\/cauldron.co\/project\/nestlings\/\">Nestlings<\/a>\u2019 are little creatures that help you squirrel away money, such as <em>Shroomo<\/em> who rounds up your transactions, transferring the incremental \u2018rounded up\u2019 balance to your savings account. If you don\u2019t give <em>Shroomo<\/em> permission to make the transfer, he\u2019ll start to cry. Money transfer actions are triggered by different, novel, events: <em>Grimm<\/em> is a lord of nocturnal spending and adds money to the savings pot for every transaction detected after 11pm. And another character, <em>Lumen<\/em>, only comes into action grabbing \u00a32 for the Nest Egg every time there\u2019s a full moon! Users also discover new Nestlings as they make new transactions and can progress through different levels of the game as their savings pot grows.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video controls src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Nestlings_Promo_1-1.mp4\"><\/video><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nestlums.io\/\"><strong>Nestlums<\/strong><\/a>: an educational app, live on UK mobile app stores and Apple\u2019s pick for \u2018Apps We Love\u2019, helps younger children grasp the concepts of digital money, teaching financial literacy through a cast of fantastical creatures and simple games. It also serves as a real-world chore-sheet with tasks \u2013<strong> <\/strong>set by individual parents \u2013<strong> <\/strong>for kids to complete and earn pocket money.<br>&nbsp;<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/cauldron.co\/project\/rare\/\"><strong>Vault Rare<\/strong><\/a>: Rare enables true personalisation for loans. People are expecting and demanding increased control when it comes to their banking, so Rare harnesses the power of Thought Machine\u2019s core banking technology, Vault, to create an experience which allows customers to have uniquely configured products.<br><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Why has it taken so long for gamification to hit the banking scene?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Mark believes that the financial sector has traditionally been deeply conservative with new creative concepts.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cI think a big reason behind this stems from the legacy banking technology side. It isn\u2019t like people in these banks don\u2019t have these creative ideas. They have them. But it takes a week to come up with the idea and then it\u2019s 1% inspiration, 99% perspiration with usually 6-9 months to get a product truly testable in the hands of the target audience. It takes such an effort to get things out there in the right form. And legacy banking technology has generally inhibited that happening. But over the last five or six years, we&#8217;re now seeing a major sea change and that old dynamic just isn&#8217;t the case anymore.\u201d &#8211; Mark Warrick<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cFor most banks across the world, replacement of core banking systems is a top priority. And I think the reason why we will see more novel products and experimentation coming into banking is because the shackles of legacy banking tech will be released&nbsp; \u2013 they can start to dream up how to win consumer market share and know the modern core will be an enabler.&#8221; &#8211; Mark Warrick<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What does Cauldron\u2019s product development journey look like?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As any creative agency will attest &#8211; market feedback is critical. A key difference with Cauldron is that it believes in investing in the build of a demo experience that is as close to the vision experience in order to truly test.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cI think the biggest thing a lot of people say is creating resilience around letting go of a concept. There&#8217;ve been a lot of things in the studio which, with heavy hearts, we&#8217;ve just had to let go.

Seen as high-risk and low-profit, SMBs have been pushed to the edges of banking and financial services. But that might change. Here are some lessons we have learned.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where does one make money in banking? Traditionally, the answer would have been two-fold: either in the extremely high volume retail banking market, or otherwise in serving large enterprises. The retail banking market is characterised by large populations of relatively homogenous consumers, and it was here that the first explosion of Fintech offerings took place. On the other side of the spectrum, banks serving large enterprises could tap into their large financial flows with bespoke, tailored solutions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet in between those extremes sits the main driver of the US economy:&nbsp;the market of SMBs.&nbsp; A market that has mostly been ignored and neglected, and could even be considered some sort of modern underbanked.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The SMB market represents a vast spectrum of business customers, ranging from single-person freelancing businesses to enterprises employing hundreds of people and generating tens of millions of dollars in annual sales. Each of these businesses tends to have financial and banking needs far more complex and unique than a retail customer, yet deliver financial streams far smaller than their large enterprise counterparts.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As such, financial services providers have often perceived the SMB market as an unattractive middle ground: too complex for one-size-fits-all offerings, and too small to profitably offer tailor-made solutions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully, that view is shifting, and in the next few years we expect to see a rapid expansion of Fintech offerings in this market. The success of Fintech offerings in the retail space has both proven what is possible and normalised the idea of financial services offered through digital-first platforms. As competition in the retail space continues to intensify, the mostly untapped market of SMB customers will start to look more and more compelling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Soon enough, we will see adventurous entrepreneurs bringing modern financial services and Fintech conveniences to every small business in the country. Those who can build elegant solutions and find viable distribution pathways will likely be well received \u2014&nbsp;most small business owners are ready to say goodbye to their mix of feature-limited business checking accounts, hard-to-access lending options, and error-prone Excel spreadsheets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the brave-hearted Fintech entrepreneur willing to venture into this new territory, we offer a few pointers and hard-won insights:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. <strong>BaaS platforms in the US are underdeveloped compared to other regions, due to their more complex environment<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Fintech products heavily rely on their underlying <em>Banking as a Service (BaaS)<\/em> platform and bank relationships. In fact, they can only innovate and disrupt to the extent that their infrastructure enables it. In order for Fintech to innovate more quickly, strong infrastructure platforms are needed. Most big BaaS providers have a focus towards the retail consumer market, leaving the BaaS space for small enterprises relatively nascent. There is a pressing need \u2014&nbsp;but no satisfying solution \u2014 for a business-first platform that makes it easy to quickly and efficiently stitch together attractive Fintech solutions that cater to the needs of SMB clients.<br><br>A Fintech entrepreneur with a SMB-focused offering in 2021 should not (yet) expect to find the maturity in platforms and infrastructure that is available for consumer Fintech. It goes without saying that building a platform sturdy enough to serve this market yet flexible enough to innovate and iterate at the speed of business is a major engineering challenge. For the moment, know that the BaaS offerings in this space are still relatively nascent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. <strong>SMBs want a bundled solution so they can focus on other things<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For practically every SMB entrepreneur, doing their finances is a pure cost center and often an emotional drain to boot. Rather than acting as a part-time CFO and spending time pulling financial services together, they seek solutions that let them focus on scaling their business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Fintech providers to cater to these needs though, the complicating factor is that every small business is <em>different<\/em>, and thus has different needs in their financial services. Expect it to be hard to build a one-size-fits all solution that satisfies a large percentage of SMB customers sufficiently to make it work. Instead, embrace the heterogeneity of the market, which leads us to our third point\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. <strong>Start with a small vertical and serve them well. Expand from there<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With such a variety of needs, the best way to approach the problem is to start with something small. For example, when we started our engagement with SteadiPay, they were focused exclusively on offering a service for small businesses to reap the benefits from credit cards while avoiding painful overdraft fees. That\u2019s a simple, narrow problem to start with.<br><br>Once that was up and running, they added additional services: a cash optimiser to put unused cash to proper use, as well as a dashboarding tool to aggregate all financial streams and help predict and optimise a small business\u2019s cash balance. In a world where hardly any infrastructure exists, even narrow problems like that take significant engineering resources. So start narrow and expand from there. &nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. <strong>In the next few years, expect US-focused solutions to pick up speed faster than any other region<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In its current state, US infrastructure to support SMB Fintechs is a decade behind leading markets like Singapore and London, but the signs are clear that the ecosystem is starting to pick up momentum. In 2020, investment in US Fintech companies outpaced EMEA investments <a href=\"https:\/\/home.kpmg\/xx\/en\/home\/insights\/2021\/02\/pulse-of-fintech-h2-20-geographical-insights.html\">by a factor of five<\/a>. In the long run, the US market of small and mid sized companies provides an area of opportunity <em>far<\/em> greater than small national markets like Singapore or the many European markets.<br><br>For the US, the market of small enterprises represents such a significant economic driver that it is impossible to ignore for much longer. Even though US Fintech players didn\u2019t get the early start and favorable tailwind of government stimulus or standardisation efforts like open banking, the first successes will be able to grow much faster and with fewer restrictions than their European or Asian counterparts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In conclusion: we see promising movement in the US SMB Fintech space, with players like Steadipay, Wise and others carving out their respective niches in this growth market. Just as in the retail Fintech space, there\u2019s ample opportunity for those willing to explore and pave their own track.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Curious to learn more about this space?

Welcome to another episode of Banking on Air. My name is Marcel Klimo and I&#8217;m the host. At Vacuumlabs, a solution-based tech powerhouse, we believe that the future is in communities when it comes to digital transformation and financial services.&nbsp; So if you&#8217;re interested in hearing more about FinTech, digital banking or payments, please don&#8217;t hesitate to subscribe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My today&#8217;s guest is Mark Warrick from Cauldron, which is part of the Thought Machine. Together, we recently implemented Thought Machine&#8217;s core banking service Vault in Hong Kong. And we also wrote the report together on how to move into the cloud to make your bank future-proof. Definitely check it out. We also became official partners, so lots of fun going on. And previously I also recorded a podcast with the Thought Machine CEO, Paul Taylor. So, if you&#8217;re interested, definitely check that out as well. But right now, as we&#8217;re talking to Mark from Cauldron, it&#8217;s a division of Thought Machine. It&#8217;s a creative lab, it&#8217;s a place where new things are created and it will spun off just to create those really cool, interesting ideas. And to start that off, Mark, when I was browsing through your LinkedIn, I noticed that you have very rich professional history and it all starts off in the Royal Navy. Can you describe how that happened and how that led you all the way to Cauldron?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Warrick <\/strong>[01:15]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So I joined the Royal Navy as a weapons engineer officer for my first five years. Very scary being posted at the age of 23, helicoptered onto a war ship in the Northern Arabian Gulf to help protect our platforms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo<\/strong><strong> <\/strong>[01:29]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what happened after that?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Warrick <\/strong>[01:30]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At that age of 16, it was sealed in me to invent. And it was because it was like a, almost a silly idea that I just worked so hard on and then it became a popular idea. In the Navy when I wasn&#8217;t on operations, doing training or being in the Indian ocean, I would be applying for patents and inventing things. So I remember vividly in the Navy obsessing in my cabin about heartbeat music. 15 years or so ago, I applied for a patent for your earphones to detect your heartbeat and then change the music based on what you&#8217;re doing in the gym.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I remember applying for a patent for a little lamp that changed the amount of light it gave out based on the ambient light coming in the window. And so that was me. I had to leave the Navy. I found my way into two different threads really joined the city, but quite quickly set up my own business, my own creative agency called Kaboom and never looked back.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then that ultimately that creative kind of invention hub then brought me into Thought Machine and creating Cauldron.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo<\/strong><strong> <\/strong>[02:29]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So can you tell me more about Cauldron?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Warrick <\/strong>[02:32]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So it\u2019s a lab, it&#8217;s a creative team. It&#8217;s engineers and designers working in a small team, only 12 of us. And we invent on top of our mothership company Thought Machine technology called Vault. So what we do is where the creative laboratory of Thought Machine, have been ever since it started. And our job is to look at what the consumers might want out of a core banking engine in the future and make sure the core banking engine can do that. Whether it&#8217;s true personalization of loans, whether it&#8217;s game world for savings, et cetera. So that&#8217;s our job. We&#8217;re just dedicated to that singlular mission.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo<\/strong><strong> <\/strong>[03:08]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of your big goals is to bring art into finance. Why is that?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Warrick <\/strong>[03:12]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it&#8217;s a space that is totally void of arts, or it has been, you start seeing glimpses of it. And there aren&#8217;t many industries left that are vacant of art. If you look at computing, it was beige boxes and megahertz and ram, stats for a long time. And then things came along like the iMac, a beautiful product, turquoise back see-through and it was a piece of art as much as it was in the world of finance, we&#8217;re still in megahertz and ram. We talk a lot about APR, is a war of APRs and art doesn&#8217;t really exist here yet. And when it comes, you start seeing the reactions to 4 million people who wanted Monzo, not just for the movement of that community and everything, but because of that bank card was a piece of art. It was a fashion item to have a coral pink bank card like that. And so, that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re starting to see. These drops of art start coming into finance and banks can start winning consumer war of market share not through APR, but because people have a feeling or want to go that way for something they see.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo <\/strong>[04:16]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So it&#8217;s almost like in the world of banking or personal finance, we&#8217;re still in that beige box era where we&#8217;re seeing the sort of first examples of Monzo or we&#8217;re seeing Starling has a nice little visual. You&#8217;re starting to see some of that more optimistic, playful, happy side of life, as opposed to just, &#8220;Oh, how much money did you spend on your gas this month?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Warrick <\/strong>[04:38]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. And if you look at traditional banks, they have put an artistic license around one aspect &#8211; trust. They always have. They&#8217;ve always gone &#8220;it&#8217;s all about trust and heritage and things&#8221;. And so, you can see that in the way that they advertise and things, but that&#8217;s where it stops. And like you say, to some products can feel more playful, some products should be sophisticated and so they have a sophisticated art direction. But we don&#8217;t see that at all. What we see, like you say is the beach box UI and this is what you&#8217;re going to get. Here&#8217;s your account balances. Here&#8217;s your transactions. Why would you want anything different?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo<\/strong><strong> <\/strong>[05:12]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;Yeah. You usually see a lot of blue because you see like these Roman and Greek columns representing old streets, for certain people you want that trust.But at the same time, in personal relationships you don&#8217;t actually build trust purely on everything being perfect, but rather imperfect. Life isn&#8217;t perfect and there&#8217;s beauty in imperfection. So it definitely makes sense to me, but a lot of conversations that I hear is we should be moving towards this sort of Asian model of super apps. You have everything in a single app. You can live your life within Weechat technically. Not technically, literally. From the moment you wake up to the moment you go to sleep, you can do all your commerce within that single application. Do you think that is something that will happen in the West or that will just not take off at all?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Warrick <\/strong>[06:56]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. It&#8217;s a really interesting topic to talk about and it&#8217;s something which we&#8217;ve been having quite detailed strategic discussions with our partner, us too, about this. What is really interesting about this is of course there is a model for superapp. We&#8217;re seeing that. But we&#8217;re seeing banks, their market share get cannibalized by great individual apps. Gohenry for parents, has got a million parents who are on there, taken away from Monzos, taken away from high street banks. We see other apps like habitat, the mortgage app, is now offering it so mortgages and that&#8217;s taking market share away. It goes on and on. And what I think is really interesting is, what are you going to do about that?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because what they&#8217;re getting right is they&#8217;re not even well-known high street names. Habitat, gohenry, why wouldn&#8217;t you do your kids banking with a high street bank? That&#8217;s been doing banking for 150 years. And so I think, and us too think as well, when there is a big case to say, do you know what super apps &#8211; the problem is, you&#8217;re trying to get all the same art direction, all into one app. And you can&#8217;t connect with that target audience. The reason why parents love gohenry is because of it&#8217;s designed exactly for them. Kids don&#8217;t want to see a normal banking app. They need to see something a lot more fun. Some people like the art direction, the cheekiness of habitat, mortgages, not everyone likes it, but some people do, enough to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what we&#8217;re seeing is that maybe there&#8217;s a future of a normal banking app, a PFM, personal finance manager banking app, that you&#8217;re seeing with your accounts and your transactions and everything else in there. Of course that&#8217;s there to stay, but there&#8217;s also a future for that same bank, whether it&#8217;s Monzo, whether it&#8217;s a high street bank, whether it&#8217;s Starling, to create many apps on the side for those individual experiences, because that&#8217;s what you want to go into for those individual moments. And then that helps you keep that market share. So it&#8217;s a really interesting topic to debate, but I think as art starts coming into finance, I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s got a choice, but to start separating out some of these experiences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo <\/strong>[08:00]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. We started to see this about a year or so ago when we started to realize that it&#8217;s almost a cultural thing in Europe, which is much more individualistic than a lot of the Asian markets, where we came up with this term, which we just randomly uses this tribal banking. Which is, it&#8217;s almost like you&#8217;re building these small little experiences for tribal communities, but not literally tribes, but the tribes who have a common goal to achieve or a common problem to resolve, as opposed to the super app situation, which is a much more sanitized or cleaner or simplified for streamlining your life as opposed to experiencing your life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Warrick <\/strong>[08:36]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. You&#8217;re going to go in there. You&#8217;re going to do a function. You&#8217;re going to get that function done. You&#8217;re going to come out. But actually, I want to enjoy how I&#8217;m saving and we&#8217;ll get onto the topic of game worlds later on but, if you want to save through play, you are not going to do it through that steral super app interface. You&#8217;re actually not even going to want to go into that because if you are for saving in a game world and you want to discover characters and do this, the last thing you want to do is open up your super app and start seeing your mortgage balance when your mindset is not in that place then.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo <\/strong>[09:06]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The thing that I really love about how you approach in Cauldron and how this entire initiative is happening is, you&#8217;re essentially taking Thought Machine, which is a next generation core banking engine. It&#8217;s almost designed to have multiple apps surrounding, connecting into it. It&#8217;s designed to be something that is multichannel by design. So it&#8217;s almost like you&#8217;re saying we have this, but we as humans, aren&#8217;t really good at understanding what the capabilities of that are yet before giving you examples of it. You&#8217;re almost there with Cauldron to say: &#8220;Open up your imagination. These are the things that can be possible with this technology if you dream big.&#8221; Is that right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Warrick <\/strong>[09:43]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. It&#8217;s the hardest thing for people to do in the context of how they are using their money today, to be able to imagine what it would be like tomorrow. And ultimately, it&#8217;s for designers to design tomorrow and then to say: &#8220;Hey, what do you think?&#8221; Rather than asking the customers of today. And so exactly, Cauldron is there to say: &#8220;Look, hey, we might not have this in five years\u2019 time, ten years\u2019 time, this is what you might see. But to help you understand that we&#8217;re not just going to show you a vision video. We&#8217;ve built it. Here it is. Put it in your hand, play this, take it away for a month. Tell us what you think. And that&#8217;s one of my most important mantras, or for Cauldron, is we have to build. And it can sometimes take us 18 months to build what took us a week to come up with. But you have to get people to use this, put it in their hands and then they go: &#8220;Oh, I really liked that.&#8221; or: &#8220;Oh, feels a little bit off to me.&#8221; That&#8217;s how we learn about what the future it&#8217;s not cheap to do, it&#8217;s an expensive game, but innovation has always been expensive. But the rewards are great.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo<\/strong><strong> <\/strong>[10:41]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. I think this is a perfect segway to just talk about some of those things that you&#8217;ve done as Cauldron.&nbsp; Because the first time I saw you was in Singapore FinTech Week and there were only two booths that I remember that were just full of people. One of them was Razor, which is the massive gaming brand which had their beautiful led green booth. And then there was part of the Thought Machine booth that had one of your demo apps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Warrick <\/strong>[11:03]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. It was Nestlings which is the savings app for people in the future. So you&#8217;ve got little characters. So you&#8217;ve got a game world. And how different is that? When you say this is savings. These little characters are all discovered a little bit like Pokemon Go characters are discovered. But this time through your transaction. They start off with simple characters, like very easy entry point, rounds up your transactions. But again we&#8217;ve got a character that&#8217;s rounding up your transactions, not just a function. Celebrate, you put 50 P away every Friday, just because it&#8217;s Friday. We&#8217;ve even connected to the weather API, which is a bit of fun here in the UK, but every time it rains, this character would put money away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a leaderboard. Wow. Now we&#8217;ve got a leaderboard for how, who&#8217;s saving the most, which Nestling character. And a level up at five pounds. Now, these characters, part of their story is that they&#8217;re on that world and they get their nectar, they get happy around savings. So you can put &#8220;don&#8217;t save&#8221;, but emotionally you&#8217;ll probably only ever do this once because you will see these Nestlings cry and they will get sad. You&#8217;ve got a foliage which has grown through, we&#8217;ve got Nestlings waving at us. They&#8217;re happy. And so again, you&#8217;re getting that feedback that you wouldn&#8217;t normally get back. So you discover them, like I say, in a very much inspired by the Pokemon style of discovery. You&#8217;ve done a transaction. This character has arrived, and it will happen in real time. The character is called Grim and you can adopt this character or not. So this is the lord of nocturnal spending and it happens because you&#8217;re out late, 11:00 PM, and you are spending money. So what Grim is there for? It&#8217;s more of a finding character. It&#8217;s going to find you 75 P for every transaction you do. So you can adopt that character or not. Lumin in that little peaceful purple moth, puts away money every full moon so every 28 days Lumin will put two pounds away for you. So you&#8217;re activating to say, this is how you want to save in order to level up. And then finally, it is the full moon so Lumin wants to save two pounds for you. You&#8217;re going to say &#8220;save&#8221;, the two pounds goes in and then you&#8217;re going: what&#8217;s this new little environment going to be?&#8221; And a new little environment is a beach world. And so now this is our level to up until 10 pounds but then you&#8217;ve got the volcano world to discover, the mystical stone level, and lots of things over the 10 levels of the game, lots of different things happen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, there you go very different to normal savings. When you give that to someone with a Nestlings bank card and tell them: &#8220;Hey, go and experience it for a month.&#8221; It&#8217;s astounding, the reactions that you got<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo <\/strong>[13:30]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what sort of feedback do you get? Is this mostly children or do you focus on adults as well?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Warrick <\/strong>[13:35]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, this, the adult market, it&#8217;s huge for it. They want to play it, it&#8217;s how they want to say. And so yeah, the feedback is it&#8217;s always: &#8220;When can I have it?&#8221; People going:&nbsp; &#8220;Wow, saving with gaming, and proper gaming, and Nestlings is really interesting.&#8221; So yeah, exciting to be getting that feedback. And of course, we&#8217;re just going to keep developing the products and keep doing it. And hopefully banks will start taking on the fact that why shouldn&#8217;t they look into game world and saving in particular. Saving should be fun. It&#8217;s quite a fun product.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo<\/strong><strong> <\/strong>[14:03]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So is this meant to be as a demo or are you building this as a separate product that has a separate sort of roadmap and plan and growth plan and that sort of thing?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Warrick <\/strong>[14:12]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We always start it off as a demo, but because we&#8217;re building them, you end up getting to the point where you go actually to build that demo out. So quite quickly as you&#8217;re building a demo, which you want to show after six to nine months, you realize that you&#8217;re not far off getting it into a production state. And so regularly with things like Nestlings, we&#8217;ve already got a UK bank reserving it. And that happens to us frequently. Our products, we&#8217;re making them, and then to upgrade them into production, isn&#8217;t a crazy expense given that it&#8217;s had 18 months worth of work on it already. So Nestlings, yes, is now being built up ready for banks to license in different regions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo<\/strong><strong> <\/strong>[15:49]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it began as an experiment that was really just the idea that this is something that we would like to see in the world. This is something that we&#8217;re seeing progress bars and badges everywhere, but that&#8217;s not really games, that&#8217;s just gamifying something. That&#8217;s not fun. It&#8217;s just, you&#8217;re trying to make it fun. At this point, you put so much time into it that it&#8217;s ready for other banks to try it out within their either their applications or a separate app.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Warrick <\/strong>[15:12]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Yeah, exactly that several of our products, they end up in the same place. Some of them stay as demos and we&#8217;re like, great that&#8217;s a demo. But in some cases like Money Monsters, we&#8217;ll talk about later, Santander bought it. They just went: &#8220;Right, we want that&#8221;. And so we&#8217;re frozen, locked out from using it now. And that happens. We&#8217;re delighted that happens because that&#8217;s what we want to do, is to say to the industry: &#8216;This is where it can go.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mentioned Nestlums quickly cause it&#8217;s one that actually we wanted to launch ourselves. Just because we wanted that experience of putting a product into market and practice what we preach. And the simplest thing that we could launch ourselves was the baby sister of Nestlings, which is Nestlums. This is for a kid, right? They&#8217;ve got their own little Nestlum character, for them to interact with, a little bit like a virtual pet. The pocket money, there is 18 pounds 50 and actually what we were trying to teach them about virtual currencies as well, and the pitfalls of it. And so we&#8217;re introducing gems to them right now. So they understand the difference between gems in apps and real money. But it&#8217;s actually a pocket money training app for young kids.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So GoHenry is good for older children, but this is for four, five, six, seven year old children. They can add a task in and if they do that task, we put lots of interactions in: &#8220;Hey, the four years old, use your finger. This is on a parent&#8217;s phone, drag it tick off. Now tap the egg.&#8221; They break open the egg, and now they can collect their coins and their gems. And now. see the Nestlums happy. But then do things like some educational games in here, but they can go into a shop and start spending their gems that they may have been awarded and start feeling like that transaction even without spending real money. But then the parents going: &#8220;Hey, It&#8217;s actually virtual money. That&#8217;s not real money. If you want to buy an icecream, let&#8217;s go and spend the coins.&#8221; And so this is a big differentiation that we wanted to teach children. It&#8217;s way more exciting to go into these little worlds and to do these little things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo <\/strong>[17:00]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is this connected in any way to an actual banking app or is this just purely for the educational purpose and the parent tracks the money?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Warrick <\/strong>[17:06]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, so purely at the moment that one for educational purposes, parent tracks the money. Now this is on the app store, we&#8217;ve got it on the UK app store. It was chosen by Apple as an app of the day, just been recently top four apps they love. And so because of that, of course, banks are now wanting to sponsor it and maybe upgrade it to be real money. But that&#8217;s our job. We did it for ourselves to have all of that practice, what we preach, get a product in the market. And also we deliberately wanted to see what we could make a product that would attract Apple&#8217;s attention. Because banking apps don&#8217;t often become an app of the day. And they don&#8217;t often get four new apps we love. And that is us talking about the super app side again, because we&#8217;re saying: if you just keep ramming everything into your superapp, Apple, one of the world&#8217;s biggest markets, is not going to pick that up and start promoting it for you.&#8221; And so there&#8217;s another part of that jigsaw of it&#8217;s the future, right? An individual app may just for that audience. And now we&#8217;re on Apple&#8217;s promotional trail. It keeps coming up on the app store and that&#8217;s just free marketing to half of the mobile phones here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo <\/strong>[18:08]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, this isn&#8217;t&nbsp; connected, but Nestling I&#8217;m guessing is connected into Vault?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Warrick <\/strong>[18:12]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So Nestlings is the heavier one. That&#8217;s connected to a current account and savings account in Vault. And so it looks at your current account, looks your spendings, and then moves money into a savings account. So a much heavier app in that sense.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo<\/strong><strong> <\/strong>[18:24]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. For Nestlums, it&#8217;s not really needed because you&#8217;re really, even you&#8217;re getting into issues like small kids can actually have cards, you can wiggle around, but you shouldn&#8217;t really be giving out cards to small children. So it makes sense within that small, a younger demographic, as opposed to like the GoHenry audience that you were speaking about earlier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Warrick <\/strong>[18:42]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, exactly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo <\/strong>[18:43]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you mentioned Money Monsters a moment ago. Can you talk a bit about that?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Warrick <\/strong>[18:47]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So Money Monsters and ,absolute projects of passion of mine. And again, around pocket money where I was desperately worried that children can&#8217;t actually see the number&nbsp; without going to their parents and say: &#8220;How much pocket money I&#8217;ve got?&#8221; Like when you and I were growing up, we used to have coins and we count them. And in a cashless world, that it is gone for a lot of children. They can&#8217;t physically see their money. And I worry about what that means in the future. Especially during curiosity moments, I would have been in my bedroom and I just empty my piggy bank and play with the money. I could physically see it. A child who&#8217;s curious about their pocket money now, they have to get to their parent and ask. And so they probably just don&#8217;t.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so this, the Money Monster, you shake it, it had a tilt switch in it. When that tilt switch got a signal from your shaking, it would then go to Vault, find out the balance and it will put it on the screen. Way ahead of its time. We&#8217;re just not seeing these really out there much in the world. And like I said, this one Santander bought the rights to it, and I think you&#8217;ll see this come out one day once the market&#8217;s right for it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo <\/strong>[19:45]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. And this is beautiful because this is extremely simple example of something, if you just think back a couple of years back &#8211; if you wanted to know your balance and your bank, you actually had to physically walk to a place, speak to a person and say: &#8220;How much is on my account right now?&#8221; And this isn&#8217;t that long ago. What is it? 15 years, 20 years that this was still considered very normal? So within one generation, we now have the capability to not only say how much is on my account or how much have I saved up, but it&#8217;s a kid can shake a monster and the monster it tells them. It reminds me of a Furby from like late nineties. If you remember, if you integrate this into a Furby, it would just tell you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Warrick <\/strong>[20:23]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, this is&#8230; When we talk about art and we talk about the creative process. Look, you can have an app on your phone that is about kids, pocket money. Kids, they want a monster, right? You can&#8217;t get away from it. They want a character, they love this money monster, all of the little accessories come off and they can make new money monsters out of it. It&#8217;s ready for licensing. And you can quite easily turn that into a million of course. And it is ready to go. And that&#8217;s the important step. But like you were saying earlier as well, if you say to someone: &#8220;Oh, we&#8217;re thinking about doing this and it&#8217;s going to be something like it&#8217;s a toy.&#8221; Until you&#8217;ve made that toy, until you&#8217;ve got that magic moment of you&#8217;re shaking it and then you see the balance come up, you really can&#8217;t gauge, whether that is a successful product or not. And so you just got to make it. And I&#8217;ll talk later about the focus group side of things and in this world of experimentation focus groups just don&#8217;t work. You&#8217;ve got to give it to, the real product to the parent at the end and the child and see what happens.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo<\/strong><strong> <\/strong>[21:20]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a fairly controversial question: have focused groups ever worked other than giving to people who will actually be the end users?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Warrick <\/strong>[21:28]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think there&#8217;s a good place for them for iterative and involved design. So at this stage, once the Money Monsters&#8217;re done, they work. Because now I can get focus groups sitting around and talking: &#8220;I think you&#8217;re right. No.&#8221; But giving 10 of these out and focused customer testing over a month: &#8220;How was it? Where did you put it in the house? Did it stay in the bedroom?&#8221; Did they ever take it downstairs? Did they ever want to take it to school? That is like gold, but you can&#8217;t get to that until you&#8217;ve got the product. And yeah, I think you&#8217;re right actually that whole sitting around ,10 people and doing a face group like that, I don&#8217;t think so. Not for this type of product. Probably for some sort of other type of research in different industries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo <\/strong>[22:08]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>New drugs for something, maybe. A lot of this has been focused on things that people would traditionally consider focused. Although, this might not be the case. Like for myself, I&#8217;m a bit of an outlier because, I game daily to this day into my thirties and I&#8217;m weird for ,many, but not for others.&nbsp; But you we&#8217;re seeing people like you&#8217;re going on the underground, you&#8217;re going in a bus, people playing games on their phone all the time. Have you done a things that are less immediately game-like or less immediately kid like?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Warrick <\/strong>[22:38]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. definitely. So it&#8217;s another key area. And again, we spent a couple of years now live in the market. Cool silo or our team&#8217;s design, wonderful company called Killik &amp; Co, a wealth manager wanted to bring their wealth expertise to the masses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Killik &amp; Co, it is for a high net worth, but bringing in all of that experience to the masses. Around 30, 35% of that whole UI is art. The more you save, the more resplendent and beautiful that piece of art becomes and the less you save, the more it dies away. Little bit like a virtual pet in a sense.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this is a product of sophistication, right? It&#8217;s a product that is designed to be very different in that sense and all those little orbs move slowly. And the design of that is you don&#8217;t want them moving too fast. This is your saving and investing. So it&#8217;s got a lot of consideration around momentum control, but this product people use, it&#8217;s live now on the app stores. They love it. It&#8217;s got a sense to it that is a different art direction. It&#8217;s also clever. That&#8217;s connecting to my bank account and working out how much I can save on that day. So he&#8217;s got a clever algorithm in there that works out recurring spending, works out how much I might be able to afford to save, being quite aggressive on mine there at the moment, but I&#8217;ve deliberately doubled up what it was going to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there you go. There&#8217;s that side, but then also Vault Rare, which is very different than. Vault Rare is a totally different product and is lone personalization. And so something I&#8217;m equally obsessed about with gaming is back in 201 I bought a pair of Nike ID trainers. Do you remember? You can customize them, you make them your own. And so back then, it just came to me like a flash and I ran into the studio and said: &#8220;Oh my goodness. Imagine if we could design a loan, just like I&#8217;ve designed these trainers. Imagine if we were&nbsp; able to have a hundred thousands customers out there and they&#8217;ve got a hundred thousand different little loans that are configured for them. &#8220;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Personalized banking, banks sometimes say it exists, but it doesn&#8217;t, you&#8217;ll have 30 million customers and you&#8217;ll have only five loans for them. And that&#8217;s not personalized. Another thing that a bank would do is go: &#8220;Oh, you want to go from 24 months to 42 months. Fine.&#8221; But this is where it gets really interesting. Most banks choose: &#8220;Oh, you can pay that monthly.&#8221; But what we say is: &#8220;what about if I want to pay back every week? What about if I want to pay back every day?&#8221; Okay. You can do that as one parameter. So now, because we&#8217;ve got monthly, weekly and daily repayment structures, we&#8217;ve got three times more loans than any other bank straight away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what else can we do? We can edit off that loan further. Supposing you&#8217;ve got a five-year loan and you decide you want to take a repayment break in the middle for six months. You can. This is the demonstration version. You could work out where you&#8217;d worked to take that repayment break. You can make it five months as you&#8217;re taking a payment break., the APR is changing as the consumer. You&#8217;re in charge of that. You&#8217;ve decided you want to repayment break for six months, you&#8217;re happy to pay more APR because for six months you don&#8217;t want to be paying that 247 pounds. Immediately&nbsp; the number of loans that can be configured, you&#8217;ve completely changed it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that becomes personalized banking because I just showed you some personalization configuration features of bank can add in whatever they can dream up, they can put into that product because we&#8217;ve got this feature within our contracts that are in the heart of Vault called parameters. And you can just keep loading those parameters in. You&#8217;re still in control in the bank of what the end product is, of course, because you&#8217;ve actually just got a few different APR, different types of products sitting there. But a customer has got the world in front of them of what they&#8217;re changing and then seeing the result of the cost of their load changing in front of them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo<\/strong><strong> <\/strong>[26:18]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Somewhat I&#8217;m like in disbelief and shock why more banks aren&#8217;t doing this or why this isn&#8217;t happening?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Warrick <\/strong>[26:25]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;Look. I think, like we said earlier, it&#8217;s one of those industries which is just entering this world of art. Computing existed for a long time before we really saw the arts come through. Like I referenced earlier, the iMac G3, that&#8217;s quite late. It&#8217;s a lovely machine, but it&#8217;s not really beautiful. It&#8217;s very broad if you like, which has obviously got its own beauty. But in terms of fashion and arts and exploding out there that the G3 took a long time. We&#8217;re in the world of finance. It&#8217;s money, but it&#8217;s quite a slow movement environment anyway. So my theory is that it&#8217;s happening. You&#8217;re going to start to see this happen and it&#8217;s not that expensive for an avatar like that to happen. It&#8217;s just having that leap of faith, that fashion and art is going to help you win consumer market share. And the banks that start doing it first and we&#8217;ll start seeing it happen and then others will follow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo <\/strong>[27:14]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you said it&#8217;s not that hard. So what sort of technologies will the bank or FinTech or an institution like this need to get to where you are with either Nestlums, Nestling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Warrick <\/strong>[27:24]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They don&#8217;t need much. It&#8217;s about the leap of a design team that is doing that, okay. So I think there&#8217;s a very different type of design team that does a super app design versus this type of design. It&#8217;s almost, you need a design team that&#8217;s done monument valley, a design team that is working with the likes of Facebook with the go-go box that they&#8217;ve just launched. All of that sort of stuff. That&#8217;s the sort of design community, it&#8217;s about people. Yeah. But then in terms of the technology, it&#8217;s cinema 4D. It&#8217;s obviously Adobe creative suite. It&#8217;s blender, a lovely 3D tool. Then in terms of getting that into an interface, unity is the place. And it&#8217;s harder to do UI well in unity, but you get all of the art benefits of it and you start to see some wonderful creative packages coming out for the likes of iOS and things. It&#8217;s not going to be only that you&#8217;ll have to rely on unity to get the results that we&#8217;re starting to see with .Your probably you wouldn&#8217;t be able to do that with Nestlings and things, but certainly what I showed you with reduce of that, is skin reducing with Vault Rare with its avatar, like flubber like you said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That , they can be done in the native world, no problems. But it&#8217;s about the leap and doing that. And for me, it&#8217;s about associating your brand with it. So when Santander bought out Money Monsters, it was great because they&#8217;ve realized that 95% of that brand was Money Monsters. But then the trust&nbsp; came from this little bit that was brought to you by Santander.And when we did all the testing, that&#8217;s all that the customers needed was like; &#8216;Oh, so who&#8217;s behind that? Oh, it&#8217;s Santander.&#8221; But you don&#8217;t want centered as whole brand over that product, cause it&#8217;s Money Monsters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo<\/strong><strong> <\/strong>[29:00] I<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;guess a large part of that also is the capability of the bank to have the APIs like Vault. We as Vacuumlabs, we&#8217;re an engineering company. So a lot of what we do is we integrate like these disparate parts of banks or fintechs to try to make them work together and really put out a nice app forward for the client, because you don&#8217;t want that client waiting a day. You want to inform them. So a part of that really is having to somehow modify the backend,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Warrick <\/strong>[29:22]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>yeah. Look, I think a big reason, and that you&#8217;ve absolutely hit it on the head, the reason why banks and even challenger banks haven&#8217;t been doing this today is because of legacy banking side. We all know it. It&#8217;s not like there aren&#8217;t people in these banks that have got these ideas. They have them. But like I said earlier, the idea it takes a week and then 1% inspiration, 99% perspiration. It Is such an effort to get things out there. Now, the legacy banking tech stops you from doing that. And these days over the last five, six years, we&#8217;re seeing a big change as that isn&#8217;t the case anymore. And most banks in the world, or one of their top 10 initiatives is replacement of core banking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s an enabler. And I think the reason why we&#8217;re seeing more experimentation coming into banking is because there&#8217;s the confidence to experiment knowing that now they can actually make that happen. And absolutely, you need that technology based there. So bankers have always had this, there&#8217;s no point inventing anything. Because whenever we go: &#8220;Oh, can we get that real time from the legacy core?&#8221; &#8220;No, you can&#8217;t.&#8221; To your point, I think this industry, it&#8217;s being woken up artistically because we&#8217;ve now got the technology to be able to do these things. Absolutely, it&#8217;s a huge impact moving on from the legacy banking term. And I think the important thing is, with all of these projects There&#8217;s a high risk they&#8217;ll never get in the market. They&#8217;ll never make it. But that&#8217;s the price of innovation. You&#8217;ve just got to keep doing it. And good things will come. There is a lot of lessons learned from world-class design studios out there where they just kept going and it was relentless within venture and ridiculous failures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo<\/strong><strong> <\/strong>[31:00]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, from your experience, something that you can share, the mistakes that you&#8217;ve made, or the things that you&#8217;ve learned that you can share that others can benefit from.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Warrick <\/strong>[31:07]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the biggest thing is a lot of people say it&#8217;s around the resilience around failure. There&#8217;s been a lot of things in the studio where we&#8217;ve just had to with heavy hearts, just go, we need to stop. And we&#8217;ve got to stop because it&#8217;s just not going to do it. I made a huge decision to get half of our studio working on what&#8217;s called code name Roma and code named Roma stops a lot of other projects, but I need that as a backbone. And it&#8217;s our first internal bank if you like, model bank, so that I can then start showing inventions on top of that. And it&#8217;s actually very much the saying if super app isn&#8217;t the future, this is the future. If we&#8217;re going to say that we want to show the industry what the future of banking might be like we&#8217;ve got to show them in entirety, not just with singular apps. We&#8217;ve got to show them how it all comes together. Lots of lessons there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think the other lesson that I would say is some ideas in that first week where you&#8217;re coming up with them and that 1% inspiration moment when you&#8217;ve got 99% perspiration, you just got to keep them to yourselves for quite a long time and not show them. Someone I used to work with called a baby tiger moment. That&#8217;s just not ready. And you have to spend months in isolation, quite lonely in your team, making something that you just don&#8217;t talk about until it&#8217;s ready to show. And so there&#8217;s a lots of psychological side to a creative studio to be successful. And I know that&#8217;s quite generic, but there&#8217;s big lessons there. And in banks, I imagine, with all of the structure, there might be a lot of traffic going. So what you, what are you working on? It&#8217;s been three months. What&#8217;s the lab come up with? You just can&#8217;t do that. And I don&#8217;t have any of that, in Thought Machine I&#8217;ve got pure, complete freedom, complete leadership buy-in, board buy-in, finance. That is all the elements that you need to make it right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo<\/strong><strong> <\/strong>[32:48]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There might not be an answer to this but how do you know it&#8217;s ready?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Warrick <\/strong>[32:51]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Very interesting. I think it&#8217;s a team moment to say, let&#8217;s take it out of the studio and start showing it. But you&#8217;re right, it&#8217;s very different for every single project and yeah, it can suddenly be shot down. And so I think that you&#8217;d need to lay that baby tiger moment. You&#8217;re like, can it fight for itself? It&#8217;s the thing. Can it survive up there by itself? Or is it weak and it&#8217;s going to end up getting gobbled up? Though it wasn&#8217;t really ready yet. Very hard to answer that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo<\/strong><strong> <\/strong>[33:17]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you got Nestlums, Nestlings, Altar, and others. Almost none of them had like traditional badged progress bar structure with leveling and that sort of things. I guess it&#8217;s hidden under the hood, but is that an intentional choice?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Warrick <\/strong>[33:29]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a common mistake when someone or an industry says they&#8217;re going to do gamification. What they do is they go for the game mechanics. They go: &#8220;Oh, leveling. Oh, progress. Badges.&#8221; And what they forget and this isn&#8217;t to make it sound derogatory, but just in general, what&#8217;s forgotten there is what makes Pokemon successful is the characters. No one&#8217;s going to go on a hunt around Pokemon if there&#8217;s no characters. What makes world of Warcraft successful is the universe, the story, and being able to explore that. Game mechanics, they just won&#8217;t succeed. It&#8217;s going to dry up very quickly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you&#8217;ve got to have something to buy into. And the reason why we like escapism and why gaming become such a massive industry is because of the escapism or characters story, everything else. And I think in our money, we need to escape a little bit. And at the moment we&#8217;re just told there&#8217;s your number, go into your banking app. This is one of my pet hates with banking app to solve in journal list. I want to go and pay a friend. So I&#8217;ll go into my banking app and I&#8217;m immediately presented with all my accounts and my mortgage and my loan. And I want it to just go in and pay a friend, but you&#8217;ve just now told me things that I didn&#8217;t really need to know right now. It&#8217;s not what I wanted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yes. The big&nbsp; thing is, t&#8217;is immersive and it&#8217;s about the avatar. And why not? So Silo, saving and investments has beautiful solar system. That&#8217;s important. And you&#8217;re investing in that as much as a level or a badge or anything else you&#8217;ve achieved.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo<\/strong><strong> <\/strong>[34:54]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, a friend of mine here in the CEE, he&#8217;s a founder of one of the local marketing agencies and he started a couple of businesses. And anytime I speak with him and when he&#8217;s talking about the new client that he&#8217;s working with, he&#8217;s always trying to figure out a way of getting some form of mascot or avatar into the marketing. Whether that&#8217;s a funny animal or something that represents the brand. And he&#8217;s done this with multiple businesses, that really reminds me of what you&#8217;re saying here. It&#8217;s you&#8217;re not trying to force the mechanics of fun of the brand, but rather you&#8217;re trying to implement something that represents the brand in a more human more&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Warrick <\/strong>[36:13]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I mean I don&#8217;t think we can deny what we said earlier. All children want to see monsters. We relate to characters a lot and brands, when it comes to consumer marketing, characters&nbsp; do win a lot. You look at EDF with their little creature on the side of vans and things. It&#8217;s endearing. And there is a connection that we have with that. And so when it comes to the game side of things and saving free play, if you&#8217;re going to play, that play can&#8217;t just be a UI. That&#8217;s just a progress bar. You&#8217;ve got to play something and say: &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;ve got a character. Oh wow. They&#8217;re in that little world there. How can I make the world a little bit tidy or for them?&#8221; And it doesn&#8217;t matter where you&#8217;re from, what age you are. If you&#8217;re into that gaming side of things. You&#8217;ll be into that. Yeah.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo<\/strong><strong> <\/strong>[36:10]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What would you say if somebody just said, this is for kids? I don&#8217;t believe this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Warrick <\/strong>[36:14]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. They&#8217;re same people that say they don&#8217;t play computer games. And that&#8217;s fine. And that&#8217;s my point is that there is an app for every different type of market and game world savings is only really for people that like that sort of thing. And as we know, there are a lot of gamers out there and they like that side of things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people will prefer Silo of course, when it comes to saving. Because it&#8217;s a sophistication, it feels like it&#8217;s in control and everything else. Some people might like Nestlings. Some people might like a very different type of app. This is the point of the conversation around super app is if you try and keep making every single experience, this bland UI, you don&#8217;t really excite any market. And it&#8217;s a bit like going down the high street and choosing coffee. If we all didn&#8217;t care about coffee, there would only be Starbucks. But there&#8217;s not. There&#8217;s independent coffee shops. There&#8217;s this, there&#8217;s that. And then there&#8217;s a time and a place to go to your user interface and what to do something, go and get a Starbucks. But there&#8217;s also a time and a place to just go into a really lovely coffee shop and have a very different experience. But at the moment what we&#8217;re doing is we&#8217;re just going we know it, you just want this. So yeah, my answer to that is that&#8217;s the market.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo<\/strong><strong> <\/strong>[37:23]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beautifully said. So people listening to this now, they&#8217;re potentially decision-makers or potentially people who would like to see something like this being built within their organization. Can they come to Cauldron and say: &#8220;We have ideas or we really like Nestlings. And I think it really fits in with our brand here.&#8221; Can they come directly to you or are you more of an idea house?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Warrick <\/strong>[37:45]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They can. And that&#8217;s the point of creating the Cauldron brand now is to say, it&#8217;s to reach out into the market. Regularly we get inbound traffic say: &#8220;Hey, I really like this concept that I&#8217;ve seen on a podcast or seen in the exhibition that you did virtually last week. Is that available?&#8221; We&#8217;re always open to that sort of thing. I think the thing that we don&#8217;t do, and this is why we are partners with us too, is when it comes to getting a project out into the market at scale into production, Cauldron&nbsp; is alchemy of people. It is an invention hub. It makes things. And then it says: &#8220;If you want them, there are routes to market and you can take all the assets and buy the concepts.&#8221; But you need to work with the right teams to get these things productionized because it would just wipe out our whole team. And then we wouldn&#8217;t be able to invent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo<\/strong><strong> <\/strong>[38:32]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quite literally a Cauldron.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Warrick <\/strong>[38:33]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Absolutely. That&#8217;s why we chose it. Yeah. Everything goes into the cauldron and there&#8217;s magic there. No, we really enjoyed coming up with that name. We all laughed our heads off when it was mentioned, we just got to do it. So it&#8217;s called the Cauldron.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also something for the future &#8211; it won&#8217;t be long now, everything that we&#8217;re building Nestlings, Vault Rare,. .. We&#8217;ve realized over the years that we&#8217;ve made something common, that means&nbsp; all of those can be actually realized. And that common&nbsp; it&#8217;s phased as a channel. We&#8217;re calling it Randevouz. And it sits on top of Vault and that&#8217;s actually innovation tooling that we&#8217;re going to start offering out to&nbsp; agencies ,&nbsp; bank innovation teams. So that they can hit the ground running just like we&#8217;re doing at the moment with Nestlings, et cetera.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo<\/strong><strong> <\/strong>[39:11]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mark, I just would like to thank you for bringing this into the world because it really needs it. It needs to rejuvenate, especially now when we&#8217;re all very distant and we&#8217;re not with each other and we&#8217;re working from remote locations, having this sort of art in this world is magical. It&#8217;s really that wonderful. So if somebody wants to either reach you, yourself, or reach Cauldron, what&#8217;s the best wait to do<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Warrick <\/strong>[39:32]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>so I&#8217;m really hot on my LinkedIn. I always get back. A lot of people talk to me vie LinkedIn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo<\/strong><strong> <\/strong>[39:37]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perfect. Thank you so much for your time, Mark.

While they have access to basic business checking accounts and other primary banking services, US SMBs generally lack access to the more mature and sophisticated financial services that both retail consumers and large-scale enterprises enjoy. Fintech founder and<a href=\"https:\/\/steadipay.com\/\"> SteadiPay<\/a> CEO <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/anthony-strike-3316089\/\">Anthony Strike<\/a> explains the struggles of operating in this relatively new space:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>\u201cAs a Fintech, I&#8217;m dependent on my Banking-as-a-Service platform and my banking relationships, and I can only innovate to the extent that they innovate. I can only bring products to market that they have capabilities for.\u201d<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Regulatory complexity and the broad spectrum of banking needs that SMB customers have further contributed to an environment where innovation happens relatively slowly. Yet despite these challenges, the first market-fit Fintech products are starting to emerge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2018, <a href=\"https:\/\/steadipay.com\/\">SteadiPay<\/a> was among the first financial service providers to venture into this underserved market. The company began by offering simple and straightforward financial products and services to make cash flow management and operating a small business more efficient for business owners. Their initial offering \u2014&nbsp;the Credit Optimiser \u2014 was a simple yet robust tool to help small business owners automate the repayment process for their credit card balance. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/anthony-strike-3316089\/\">Anthony<\/a>:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>\u201cManaging cash, the timing of cash, and your card limit were just these complex, annoying things that small business owners didn&#8217;t want to have to manage manually. And it was our first little clue into just how many manual processes and legacy technologies and friction points a small business owner has to deal with in just managing finances.\u201d<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>For a small business, one of the benefits of using a business credit card is access to cashback offers, reward points and other perks. Credit cards also bring the risk of high interest payments and sometimes unexpected costs at the end of the month. To help solve this problem, <a href=\"https:\/\/steadipay.com\/\">SteadiPay<\/a> designed its Credit Optimizer product. By allowing a business owner to connect both their credit card and bank accounts to the Credit Optimizer, the app automatically tracks spending behavior on the credit cards, and automatically pays off the outstanding credit from their bank account to avoid high fees and unnecessary expenses, while still allowing users to reap the benefits of paying with their credit card.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the success of the Credit Optimizer, <a href=\"https:\/\/steadipay.com\/\">SteadiPay<\/a> expanded its SMB product offering in 2019 with a suite of tools to make cash management as easy as possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To increase cash management optimization beyond just credit card spending, the company identified a second opportunity to optimize under-utilized cash reserves. This would become the Cash Optimiser product. On the \u2018<a href=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/podcast\">Banking on Air\u2019 podcast<\/a>, CEO <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/anthony-strike-3316089\/\">Anthony<\/a> explains the concept:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>\u201cWe wanted to launch a high-yield, bank-agnostic sweep account for small businesses. We wanted to let small businesses put any cash they had on hand to good use. Even for a short amount of time, and even for a small amount of dollars&#8230; and get the best rate on the market.\u201d<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>SMB business owners simply connect their business bank account to <a href=\"https:\/\/steadipay.com\/\">SteadiPay<\/a>, and the service automatically moves unused cash reserves into a high-yield savings account, then pulls it back to the checking account whenever the cash is needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In expanding their product offering with extremely simple value propositions to small business owners, <a href=\"https:\/\/steadipay.com\/\">SteadiPay<\/a> is a frontrunner in offering modern Fintech solutions to this traditionally underserved, but vitally important, market segment. The company continuously strives to make cash management easier for busy entrepreneurs.<br>&#8212;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From an engineering standpoint, one of the key components of the Cash Optimizer product was an integration with the Yodlee API, to enable access to a user\u2019s bank balance and transaction history. Early in the development lifecycle, <a href=\"https:\/\/steadipay.com\/\">SteadiPay\u2019s<\/a> outsourced development team ran into persistent issues with this API integration. <a href=\"https:\/\/steadipay.com\/\">SteadiPay<\/a> CEO <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/anthony-strike-3316089\/\">Anthony Strike<\/a> then decided to bring Vacuumlabs developers onboard to resolve the technical pain points, bring the Yodlee integration online and build the whole MVP from scratch in only 3 months.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Impressed with the ease of working with both the Vacuumlabs teams and the quality of engineering, all engineering work was moved&nbsp;over to Vacuumlabs. In the months that followed, Vacuumlabs&#8217; team of five developers worked to build out the full product offering \u2014 ranging from product design and usability to back-end engineering, testing and release.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building on the uptake and success of the Cash Optimizer, <a href=\"https:\/\/steadipay.com\/\">SteadiPay<\/a> now offers a full cash management dashboard \u2014 the cockpit view that a business needs to see what is happening inside the business, and spot areas that require attention or could be optimized. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/anthony-strike-3316089\/\">Anthony<\/a> explains:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>\u201cCashflow is the lifeblood of a small business and understanding how many dollars are moving in and out of your business is the most important thing you need to do as a small business owner. But it&#8217;s also not remotely why you got into business, and it&#8217;s also a big manual chore.\u201d<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Using the dashboard a business owner will be able to view historic cash balances, track where money is being spent, and based on algorithmic intelligence, receive predictive data and forecasts on future cash balances.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>\u201cWe did more than 300 customer interviews and talked to more than a hundred accountants who support small businesses as we were researching how to make this product work\u201d<\/em> <a href=\"https:\/\/steadipay.com\/\">SteadiPay<\/a> CEO <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/anthony-strike-3316089\/\">Anthony <\/a>explains, <em>\u201cAnd one of the things we came away with was that it&#8217;s not enough to just give the small business a forecast or data. There are a lot of forecasting tools in the market. But you don&#8217;t just dump a forecast on them and say \u201cOkay, here&#8217;s your data, go figure out what you need to do.\u201d \u2014 they need help.

Mis-selling and PPI scandals have prompted some in the sector to pull back from offering savings and investment products, yet other players have invested many millions and have still failed to date to turn a profit from these services. So now, in 2021, are UK retail banks presenting customer-friendly savings and investment propositions for retail clients? And what will it take for more incumbents to get on board with this once again?<br><br>In our \u2018Banking on Air\u2019 podcast host Helene Panzarino welcomed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/nikolaihack\/\">Nikolai Hack<\/a>, Head of Strategy &amp; Partnerships at cloud-native savings and investment platform, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nucoro.com\/\">Nucoro<\/a> to explore how Nucoro\u2019s powerful tech platform can deliver highly versatile and cost-effective savings and investment solutions for retail banking. The cost structures of traditional money management offerings render this broad tier of customers in the moderate wealth bracket unprofitable, given the small total amount of assets in their portfolios. However, customer demand certainly exists, with more than 80% of UK bank customers saying they would like their retail banks to come back with savings and investment propositions, but the banks are mostly failing to come forward. So how does Nikolai think incumbents are currently positioned?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cHigh Street banks have an extremely strong entry point with customers because current accounts are so ubiquitous and touch on daily life. This contact should also translate into one of the biggest opportunities to capture people&#8217;s attention when it comes to offering additional financial services such as savings, investing and pensions.\u201d &#8211; Nikolai Hack<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Thus, retail banks have a huge relationship \u2018reserve\u2019 that they should be able to capitalize on. As a high street provider you have strong long-term connections to an enormous breadth of customers: individuals who are with you for the long haul, not just to take advantage of a specific perk, or extra convenience in their day-to-day finances. But it\u2019s clear that the high street banks have been failing badly to transfer this relationship capital to the bottom line.<br><br>According to Nikolai, Nucoro\u2019s aim with its platform is <\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201c&#8230;to build something for retail banking incumbents which is every bit as exciting as what some of the challenger banks are offering and creates real benefits and value for individual customers so that you can stem your loss of market share that\u2019s currently being grabbed by the neobanks.\u201d<br><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Nucoro is part of a joint venture and its partners are investment house<a href=\"https:\/\/www.edmond-de-rothschild.com\/en\"> Edmond de Rothschild<\/a> in Switzerland and Spain-based<a href=\"https:\/\/www.etsfactory.com\/\"> ETS Asset Management<\/a>, one of Europe\u2019s biggest quantitative asset managers. Nikolai stressed that even though the Rothschilds have been around as a dynasty for hundreds of years, you only stay relevant as a banking powerhouse over that length of time if you\u2019ve made some very good business decisions along the way. So when the time came to define Nucoro\u2019s business concept it was decided that scalability was going to be paramount to their offering:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><br>\u201cOur powerful technology was already providing wealth management solutions for HNWs and incorporating a significant degree of automation. So why not use this tech to bring private banking-grade asset management to a much broader retail market? To deliver this, the technology needs to automate as many processes as possible so you\u2019re still able to deliver individually-managed portfolios for every client, but at scale. The automation creates the all-important cost efficiencies.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0&#8211; Nikolai Hack<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Nucoro initially launched as a live, regulated platform in the UK but this move was primarily a testbed and stepping stone. The JV partners collectively saw much greater potential to utilize the tech foundation that they had built to support external partnerships. Therefore rather than to try and directly build just one proposition and grow that in the marketplace, it made much more strategic sense to enable others to build a wide variety of propositions on Nucoro\u2019s platform. Nikolai says,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p> \u201cYou can build a single ecommerce online shop, or, you can build a Shopify. With Shopify you enable millions of other people to build their own ecommerce stores. And enabling multiple unique offerings is our model at Nucoro too. We provide an amazing platform on which to build savings, trading and investing propositions for retail clients.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The initial strategy was to target wealth managers and IFAs however these markets proved extremely legacy heavy and insufficiently agile with a poor appetite for change. So Nucoro pivoted away from this sector picking out a new niche\u2014It\u2019s the High Street, Jim but not as we know it. This is a much wider market, with some UK retail banks and insurers having tens of millions of customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How can a High Street bank plug into and capitalize on \u2018unmet demand\u2019 using Nucoro\u2019s solutions? Nucoro\u2019s platform is secure, highly scalable and 100% cloud native. It can be customized to incorporate automated saving, goal-based saving and investing, direct equities trading, automated investment solutions and personalized investment goal setting. The bank can create extra value from its underutilized balance sheet through using the platform to encourage customers to channel funds into savings and investment products.\u00a0Nikolai emphasizes that:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p> \u201cAt the same time, you as the bank can seek to capture a new generation of customers in the 18 to 25 age bracket through your digital money management offerings\u2014thereby leveraging your existing customer relationships to secure new ones, such as attracting the young adult offspring of your core customer base.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Most importantly, a bank putting its own solutions on a customizable platform is going to result in much better product fits because you\u2019re going to be getting best-in-class. On the back of these tech solutions a savvy bank will be able to bring new products to market to rival the challengers. What\u2019s more Nikolai underscores that partnering means you can deliver new products: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cOn time and on budget. And at a fraction of the cost of what it would\u2019ve cost you had you attempted this yourself and will also take only a fraction of the time.\u201d<br><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Nikolai highlights how the platform approach is gaining steady ground as the business strategy of choice but there can still be a conceptual disconnect: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cIt makes little sense to try and build something that someone else is clearly better positioned than you to do. Though, the biggest hurdle for us to overcome isn\u2019t another market player. Rather, it&#8217;s the internal mindset of High Street banks, believing that they can build these investment platforms on their own. That&#8217;s the lever we need to push because otherwise they are setting themselves up for failure. Whereas if you partner you can offer your customers best-in-class solutions.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Banks should take inspiration from what has already been newly created: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cIf you build around your current business model and processes, it\u2019s not going to work. It&#8217;s going to fail from a UX perspective. Instead look to integrate the right elements: choose the right players and then by connecting them, build a solution where the total sum greatly exceeds that of its parts in what it delivers in terms of value to your business.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Building on a platform there\u2019s no need to reinvent the wheel and you can play to your strengths\u2014accessing your client base and capitalizing on your brand. This is where existing players have a significant advantage they can leverage their strong and enduring relationships.<br><br>So incumbents bring the relationships into the profit equation, companies such as Nucora bring the tech solutions and we at Vacuumlabs can help you integrate this technology to create amazing products with wonderful customer experiences.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, at Vacuumlabs, we share Nikolai view: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cWe believe that an ecosystem of best-in-class players will innovate much faster than anyone going at it alone.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>To find out more about opportunities of banks to leverage on their client base and provide efficient saving &amp;

My name is Helene Panzarino and I&#8217;m your host for today. At Vacuumlabs, a solution-based tech powerhouse, we believe that the future is in communities when it comes to digital transformation and financial services. If you&#8217;re interested in hearing more about FinTech, digital banking or payments, please don&#8217;t hesitate to subscribe. And as usual, I&#8217;m not alone on this podcast. Today I&#8217;m joined by Nicolai Hack from Nucoro and we&#8217;re going to hear about what Nucoro is obviously, but we&#8217;re also going to have a conversation around what it&#8217;s like to be a business in different parts of the world, in the space that we&#8217;re all in as well. Nick, do you want to introduce yourself to the audience?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nikolai Hack: <\/strong>[00:00:40] Yes. Absolutely. Thank you, Helene. Good to be with you, good to speak to you. I&#8217;m Nicolai, I&#8217;m the Head of strategy and partnerships for Nucoro. I&#8217;ve been with the firm for a very long time, for as long as we exist. Even before we were Nucoro, when we were a different team working on a different project. Then became, by now as a client Nucoro, as we moved on to work on different things and to what we work on now. I came to London, because we started in Madrid three and a half years ago, four years ago, actually. I&#8217;ve been here ever since I was in a more operational role for awhile. So taking care of all the things that happen behind the curtain is basically the illegal aspects of contracting with the third parties. The hiring policies and all the things you don&#8217;t necessarily hear and see much of that when you deal with the business. But now I&#8217;m for, the last year or so in this role where I built nurture, initiate new partnerships with wide range of players across different verticals that help us build client solutions and then I guess the strategy part is the fun element of doing stuff like this to come on to your podcast, for example,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:01:39] We talk about the strategy that you&#8217;ve taken as affirming in terms of your expansion and which areas you are seeing coming to the fore. Because let&#8217;s roll it back to the fact that Nucoro is broadly speaking in the FinTech vertical world. We&#8217;ll talk about wealth management, robo advisory as our buckets and where you want to fit into that. And we&#8217;ll talk more about that as we go through this podcast. You and I have had many conversations about the space initially not achieving the targets for assets under management that was set out in around 2014 by a lot of the industry. By the time we got to 2018, it was still half of what it was meant to be and we ask ourselves, why was that? And where in the industry moving to, in terms of the incumbents, is there a possibility for incumbent financial institutions to get on board with this again? And when we talk about wealth and advisory and what it is that the individual wants, why we&#8217;re in this space, where we haven&#8217;t achieved what was in the forecast and we look at the moment we&#8217;re in now, how have we moved on to a time where this vertical is part of FinTech and will it have its day? We could also look at the impact of the pandemic and the impact of the world becoming much more aware of it globally and how we&#8217;re not just looking at the US and the UK anymore. So let&#8217;s roll it back to describe really where your place in the universe of FinTech vertical is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nikolai Hack: <\/strong>[00:02:58] Maybe I have to explain that I&#8217;ll go back half a step or a step maybe just to explain where we come from. It has to do with what I said in my introduction, where I said we were in different teams. So when we started working in 2016, early 2016 together, where we come from is a joint venture between Ariane de Rothschild, the head of the Rothschild family of Switzerland and ETS Asset management is a quantitative asset manager in Spain, one of the biggest ones in Europe actually. And their idea was we have incredible technology that highly automated fashion manages the money of high net worth individuals. Why don&#8217;t we use this tech and bring private banking great asset management to a mass market? To do that at the core of what you need is technology to automate as many processes as possible. So you&#8217;re still able to do individually managed portfolios for every single client at scale. Because if you don&#8217;t have technology that automates and brings down the unit cost, you cannot do it at scale. You can only do it, again for the high net worth individuals. So we started working on this project and what then became EXO investing. EXO investing it&#8217;s a live&nbsp; robo advisor platform now in the UK. It built the tech, we launched, it got regulated, went through that entire process and brought it to the market in the UK. For the two parties, ETS and the Rothschild family, this was as much a test balloon, but also a stepping stone into what we became afterwards. Which was actually, we realized, okay, there&#8217;s a much bigger opportunity to not directly try to build one proposition for the market, but instead use the tech foundation that we had built and allow others to build all kinds of propositions on that basis. So if you want, you can build one e-commerce online shop or you build Shopify, right? And you enable thousands, millions of other people to build their e-commerce shops. And that&#8217;s exactly what Nucoro is and Nucoro platform is all about. We are a fantastic foundation to build saving, trading, investing, also wealth to a smaller degree, but saving, investing, and trading proposition. So for retail clients, that&#8217;s where our main focus is. Now we come to what you said, who was interested in this and whom do we try to sell this to. Where&#8217;s the opportunity? For quite a while we actually looked at the wealth manager market. And we thought there was space and there was appetite and the wealth management also in the UK, didn&#8217;t you very specific the IFA market and their wealth management is an extremely slow moving sector. Some stomaneded by quite legacy or even legacy heavier structures than you would find in banking or insurance from a tech perspective. But then also just the firms are run by relatively old individuals actually. Little appetite for change for disruption, for renewal, which is why we moved away from that sector entirely. The biggest opportunity in that space to build propositions with the technology that we have is for existing banks and for existing insurance firms who have millions of clients. They have the high street banks here, double digit millions of clients in the UK, of course. And most of their clients have deposits, they have a card, maybe they do some lending, maybe a bit of effects when they travel, but for the big, big chunk of retail clients, they don&#8217;t do anything with their money. It just sits there. It sits on the balance sheet of the bank, costing the bank money, if you think of negative interest rates, which are all even in the UK sometimes discussed. And in means of inflation it costs the individual money. Actually you lose purchasing. Probably not doing anything with it. So it&#8217;s a lose-lose situation. For a bank to build an exciting proposition that can rival what some of the challenges have built and are building the Robin Hood of this world the eToros, the Acorns, the&nbsp; Money boxes also the Revoluts. If you can build something like this and stop the loss of market share towards these challenges, towards these aggressive entrance into your home turf by building something that is as exciting as well working and also creates a benefit and value for the client, then you&#8217;ve turned the lose-lose into a win-win and that&#8217;s what we try to be a part of.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:06:42] Fairly interesting, and actually listening to you I reminded of a few years back when there was a bit of a shake up in the sector in the UK. I can&#8217;t speak for the rest of the world where there was some miselling and there was a real fear, I think, from the bank&#8217;s perspective that they could get wrapped up again and get their knuckles rapped again and they could be fine. A lot of them pulled back. A lot of independent financial advisors pulled out of the space because of miselling. And if you lived in the UK or you were in this space, you heard of PPI, which was the Payment Protection Insurance scam. So all around at the time and it really made the market shrink, but it also put a spin on what was a normal thing, if you&#8217;ve got a mortgage or an investment tool from your bank, you would normally get the wealth or the other tool with it. That was really, it changed, right? So that was pretty standard fair. It probably wasn&#8217;t the most high performing investment portfolio, but you could change it from a bank because it wasn&#8217;t something that anyone thought about. It just came with the package. It came with the mortgage. When it stopped, it was almost like saying there was a little bit of a gap in the market until we started to see, as you say, people coming into the market, targeting this space, people that were not yet sitting on a decent amount of money, but we&#8217;re all aware that we were encouraging everyone to save and invest because we all know at some point, wherever you are in the world, our pension pots are not going to be enough for us. And that market wasn&#8217;t wealthy enough to create breakevens or profits for the companies that were entering it. Some of the ones you mentioned that are profitable. Yes. Some of them are not profitable. Some of them have raised hundreds of millions of one currency or another and are still finding their way around. And I think we&#8217;ve discussed that something like over 80% of bank customers would like their banks, their retail banks, to come back with a proposition, but they&#8217;re not doing it. I wonder if part of that is because they were burned and they were frightened from going down that road again. They don&#8217;t have the internal expertise. They don&#8217;t have the internal technology, which is where you can plug in, for example. And then what&#8217;s the role of the intermediary themselves? Is there a B2B proposition, almost like a junior B2B proposition that isn&#8217;t going into an organization with 30 million customers, but go into the brokers or the financial advisors in the middle to give them a level of intelligence to then share with the end user?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nikolai Hack: <\/strong>[00:09:05] You mentioned a lot of good points. The interesting one is what you said about the well miselling and what that triggered and it&#8217;s a part of a bigger package, right? And especially with the last year, there was a lot of talk of K-shaped recovery. It was right that the stock market goes up, but the real economy actually goes down in wealth management that has been a K-shaped development for quite a while, that actually AUM goes up and if the SSI management go up, but profitability is constantly and has been declined for two decades now. Since 2000, it&#8217;s a staggering picture, if you see it on a chart, actually AUM up 30% profitability on 30%. So in a market where there&#8217;s more money to manage, you actually make less money with it. And that&#8217;s just says a lot about this industry, how inefficient it is. How low productivity must be, how bad performing a lot of the marketing and sales efforts must be. A lot of things are to a degree broken a bit. I think there&#8217;s some organic limit to how much reform you can trigger and how much you&#8217;ve reform or renewal you can kick off, which is really sometimes ends with the firm, not surviving, but disruptive change. It&#8217;s the new players that come in and they actually take the entire cake, not only a piece of the cake. And I think to a degree, full wealth management is true, but you&#8217;ve mentioned also there are still some players who came into the space of investing so saving, and I&#8217;ve mentioned some names already that are actually quite successful, but then still the major entry point for people when it comes to money is a bank. It&#8217;s the one point of also financial connection outside of groups of friends and also our family that we automatically turned to because obviously everybody has a bank account. You need a bank account for your salary, your bank account to pay your bills, etc. So it&#8217;s a, why not mandatory. You will have a bank account at some point in your life. This entry point is extremely strong. This is also why the biggest opportunity to capture people&#8217;s attention when it comes to any of those things, saving, investing, pensions protection. If you think of a life, what is life insurance? A life insurance is a forward looking arrangement for your money, right? While the product has a different name, it&#8217;s not very different to a retirement portfolio. All of these entry points where banks have the strongest connections to the individual, for them, the opportunity to do something and build something new, take inspiration from what has been built, you don&#8217;t have to reinvent the wheel, but to make use of a leverage. They have also not only in terms of actually existing client base, but also in terms of friends. And that&#8217;s something interesting while a lot of people will say they don&#8217;t like bankers or they don&#8217;t trust bank us, they will still trust the high street bank more than a challenger bank with their salary. That&#8217;s just the fact that it&#8217;s reflected in a lot of the balances to have the challenger banks where what&#8217;s a couple of hundred pounds or 250, 300 pounds, maybe the average account balance. These strong relationships to use them, that&#8217;s the opportunity for the existing players. I think there, enabled with the right technology, because that&#8217;s the enabler. If you don&#8217;t have the right tech, if you build it again, based on your current business model, your current processes, your current operational model as well, it&#8217;s not going to work. It&#8217;s going to fail from what UX perspective. What&#8217;s more important, it&#8217;s going to fail commercially from a business perspective.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>]<strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:11:59] So there&#8217;s a question around the technology that banks have and that they need to open up the concept of having technological plugins. And obviously, you know, we&#8217;re building products and services. You have technology that you can add on. We can do work around the integration and they can get on with it and I&#8217;m sure there are times where there&#8217;s a debate between the department of a bank and people that actually wants to move things forward. Whether or not they run in parallel or whether there is a resistance to this, but it seems mad given the size of the market and the demand of the population, not to do them externally. Now we&#8217;re talking about this case, the UK, and I&#8217;m sure you have a sense of your connecting the dots between Spain and here and other parts of the world. And now of course, you&#8217;re looking at MENA or specifically Bahrain. Is it the same everywhere or the attitude&#8217;s different in other parts of the world?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nikolai Hack: <\/strong>[00:12:51] Actually do your first point because you mentioned it, the it departments, because it&#8217;s such a constant phenomenon, of course of the conversations we have. That&#8217;s actually interesting because for just coming quickly back to wealth management, where tech players did themselves a big disservice was by choosing the term robo advice because robo sounds like no people and wealth management is a people business. So obviously the hostility there was only fueled by just the terminology, which I totally understand. If your business relies on the people to people interaction or robot sounds like, that&#8217;s not going to happen. Why would I want that in my business? For internal IT departments of especially banks platform quite necessarily at the core of what a platform is,&nbsp; it&#8217;s not custom software development. So it is to a degree, a bit of a dethrone of the existing emperors. Maybe of course, in the end it&#8217;s exactly right what you said. It&#8217;s about integrating the right pieces and that is actually the more important work to choose the right players and then by connected them, then build a solution where the total sum is bigger than the sum of the individual parts. That&#8217;s the, what I would say is the job with the right amount of effort and work should be spent by IT departments not trying to build themselves because it&#8217;s a bit of a futile effort. But to your other point, what&#8217;s interesting is of course the stage of development of a market. Here in the UK and Western Europe, we have quite established of course, banking and financial services markets. Very established, obviously. Here, the UK trading nation, some of the banks, you&#8217;re a hundreds of years old, actually not necessarily with the same name. Well as institutions at the quarter Kent they can be hundreds of years old that not only leads obviously to some cultural impact of how your work as an organization, how open you are to change for good reasons. Sometimes it doesn&#8217;t make sense to jump on always the newest fad, but especially in technological terms, it means you have a lot of buildup of layers and layers of systems and technology legacy that holds you back. Absolutely clearly there is no denying it and everybody knows it. This is no secret within any of the trenches services industries. Go to the middle East, for example. Go to the SE region, go to Africa , to the NA part or even Sub-Saharan Africa obviously, none of that is there. Especially when it comes to the technology infrastructure, you don&#8217;t have decade old systems. You have maybe a decade old systems or maybe one and a half, two decades old systems, but it makes a big difference for how you approach technological change. Then of course, a big factor as well as demographics and how that impacts what appetite there is for what kind of propositions. Again, think of some middle East, or again Africa. Young&nbsp; populations. The average age of Saudi Arabia is in the high twenties or something. It&#8217;s crazy. The average age of Germany is 42 years, I know it because it&#8217;s where I&#8217;m from. So huge difference in what these people think, what kind of propositions you want to build. I spoke to a German insurance executive, I come to him and I talked about, Hey, what do you can build with our tech is a Robin Hood challenger. to challenge what Robin Hood builds and he says, that&#8217;s very interesting, but what I have, my biggest problem is, I have people who are 65 to 70 years old, their life insurance matures, the policies up for maturity, they haven&#8217;t heard from me in 25 years, but some of them might not even know that they have this insurance policy. What do I do with them? It&#8217;s like a completely different mindset, obviously driven by the demographic situation of the market. So that influences a lot what is built and what appetite there is, but also from a technology perspective, what you can build on how easy or difficult it can be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:16:04] Interesting. Isn&#8217;t it? And actually, as you were talking, I was thinking there&#8217;s a need for a dashboard for the back book of all these big banks and insurance companies. So you know exactly what you have and you can say about the touch that you have with people as well. It makes perfect sense and that is a foray or stepping into this part of the world, part of more global expansion plans for Nucoro?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nikolai Hack: <\/strong>[00:16:26] For us right now,&nbsp; Europe is where we are. Then the middle East is just because we have some connections that we can use into the region and some partners there with whom we can work, so that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s a bit more interesting than anything that&#8217;s probably a bit further away. Of course long-term the US is extremely interesting. To go to the US is expensive. To go to the US takes a lot of thought, takes a lot of planning. It&#8217;s not something that we want to entertain at this point. I can say that quite openly. What might enable it is maybe in the context of a strategic investor. Maybe somebody who comes in and then opens up that market with us and we open up the market together. Maybe that is probably more likely than us doing alone. I don&#8217;t think we will do it alone. For the foreseeable future, Europe is where we are. We have four offices now. We have here London, where I am. We have in Madrid, our engineering and product team, our CTO our CEO Lennart, he&#8217;s also&nbsp; in Madrid. Then we have two offices in Switzerland actually, one in Zurich, one in Geneva because of the connection to the Rothschild family. who have a good network in Switzerland if we want to tap into, which is why we&#8217;re there with two different locations, even. That&#8217;s the setup for the moment and I think you won&#8217;t stray too far for the foreseeable future, I think.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:17:33] When you say Switzerland, it reminds me as well what you&#8217;re feeling is all around the hype around Bitcoin and other coins and cryptocurrencies. And whether or not we should be investing in them or is it not for the faint of heart and we should stay away? Is that&#8217;s something that we should not put in our portfolios in your opinion?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nikolai Hack: <\/strong>[00:17:50] It&#8217;s interesting. I like&nbsp; the question, right, that we are not the fact that we talk about it NASA is a testament to how big of a wave there is at the moment. I do believe that given the current monetary policy regime globally around the world, where there&#8217;s a lot of ease around the creation of money and there&#8217;s a lot of newly printed feared currency here in Europe with the ECB, same goes of course, for the FED and the US. All of that oversupply of feared currency makes things that are harder to reproduce and to expand the supply of more interesting and that&#8217;s real estate, that&#8217;s gold and commodities as well, which still increased, but both of them can be increased, but not as easily. And then Bitcoin as well is also rare. For Bitcoin, especially compared to the two we have totally fixed supply. So I think that&#8217;s what makes it very interesting. I don&#8217;t think there will be a turnaround in the monetary policy. I think cryptocurrencies are here to stay, not all of them, but Bitcoin definitely. I think it will be a very interesting asset over the coming years. I am quite bullish on it. But then, like I said, if you have high degrees of inflation, which I expect, then you should be bullish about everything that can achieve be printed in, that&nbsp; kind of produce in a printing machine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:18:59] There was some question in the market, it&#8217;s like the $64,000 question, isn&#8217;t it? Why is all of the money and more money being printed, but it&#8217;s not in circulation. Okay. I&#8217;m voting for the fact that it&#8217;s under people&#8217;s mattresses because when people are frightened, they revert to what they think is safer, which is why gold is obviously also having a moment. It&#8217;s being hidden somewhere in case they need to get to it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nikolai Hack: <\/strong>[00:19:22] Yeah. And quite clearly, you know,&nbsp; the restrictions around COVID, it plays a huge role in the development of asset markets. You don&#8217;t go out, you don&#8217;t go to the pub, you don&#8217;t go to the bar, you don&#8217;t go to the cinema, but if you have kept your job, all of a sudden. Probably your disposable income is up by a lot of people by a hundred percent potentially because a lot of things just have fallen away and if not, it&#8217;s by maybe 50%, 30%, whatever 20% . You have more money per month, what do you do with that money? You just save it, you put it away and the deposit, you leave it on the bank or you throw it into your Robin Hood account and start trading, what was a Game stop shares. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve heard that story, but now Game Stop, the very likely defunct like retail outlet for computer games, the stock shot up, but from 10 to 100, I think over the last week or so, because someone had the idea to force a short squeeze on some hedge funds in a Reddit forum. I mean, it&#8217;s an insane story, but that kind of stuff is possible at the moment. So there&#8217;s a lot of money going around that doesn&#8217;t find a lot of very productive uses, but instead finds its way into the exchanges finds its way in the UK, always into property where prices everybody thought it would collapse they have not, they&#8217;re still going up. So yeah, that&#8217;s what a lot of money does it&#8217;s get a bit more expensive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:20:31] And I think there&#8217;s been a surge in e-commerce spending as well, spinning up something like 400%, which was making a heyday for the payments industry and who knows where we&#8217;ll be when we come out of this as well. I just wanted to touch also a little bit on the founder story, because you mentioned Lennart and the two of you go way back, don&#8217;t you in terms of your meeting and then your journeys as entrepreneurs. It&#8217;s always interesting to see where people came from.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nikolai Hack: <\/strong>[00:20:54] Yes, we do go back when we met in high school, actually, and yeah, just stayed in touch when different ways. He went straight into the world of financial services, worked in Venture capital for awhile, then went into quantitative asset management and I went into the policy realm for a while. I worked in some international institutions. I spent some time at the EU actually in Brussels and then went into consulting. And then, so especially the conversation started when he talked about what they do at his current employer at ETS, what kind of technology they work with and what it is used for and what the audience is. At that time this was the initial wave of robo-advice right? The first time, the wealthy FI&#8217;s and scalable capital and here in the UK, the not max, cause they were around for two, three, four years maybe. And we looked at that and said, look, that works quite well, but then you can do a lot more. Actually, if you looked under the hood of what was called robo, there wasn&#8217;t that much robo there. It was still quiet. There were a lot of people in, and you looked at the job offers and you saw, they hired people in operations and like portfolio managers, and they have a chief investment officer. And I&#8217;m not saying that all of these things are wrong. I think they&#8217;re there for very good reasons sometimes, but we thought it&#8217;s robo why is it not really a robot? And that&#8217;s what we wanted to do. Then we got together with obviously we needed funding and we found them in the the partners I mentioned and the Rothschild family and members of the Rothschild family. And that&#8217;s the funny bit, right, you think this as a family, as a dynasty that has been around for hundreds of years, why would they be interested in something that disrupts in all industries, but you only stay relevant for hundreds of years if you make good decisions. And if you place some well-placed bets from time to time, obviously, that&#8217;s how it works. We found them and very trusted, very lucky to have them as partners. The other parties is ETS who brought the initial tech of the actual portfolio management, because that&#8217;s what they were doing before the stock of high net worth individuals or institutional clients actually. Some people say,&nbsp; I always wanted to be an entrepreneur and I had this idea for so long and then, but there&#8217;s not really a story. We saw what was happening, how others were doing things and that gave us an idea to maybe look at different ways of doing it. And this was the origin, I think, for what was the effect on XO and now it&#8217;s, of course we spent X, so out X investing, we spun it out and now actual thing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:23:05] I wanted to ask, if you go back in this conversation we had about the bank, say, As we wrap up, if you could say to a large financial institution, Hey, you have unmet demand and we have a solution and we can get that integrated really easily, what would be the one to three things that you would want to say to them to get them into the conversation?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nikolai Hack: <\/strong>[00:23:25] I could go throu our pitch deck and the USP&#8217;s, but I really think thats not that complicated. I mean, at least for me, you know, it&#8217;s not that complicated. But you look at your balance sheet and talk to your CFO, a lot of CFOs, especially European banks are worried about this. We have a balance sheet it&#8217;s too large. We have too much money sitting there doing nothing. On the other hand, talk to your retail guys. They say we have clients who have kids, but one, we don&#8217;t know their kids and if we look at our onboarding numbers of 18 to 25 year olds in a market like the UK, it&#8217;s not looking too good. They go somewhere else. A lot of them go to the challenges. And then go to your tech guys and talk to them and ask them about any kind of product that you&#8217;ve built. Did it come in under budget and did it come in within the specified timeline of the things that you were building yourself over the last couple of years, whatever that was? And if you&#8217;ve talked to these three different people,&nbsp; then if you&#8217;re lucky we catch you right at that moment, and then we can talk to you about, Hey, there&#8217;s a huge opportunity. You can build stuff that can rival the challenges, if you have the right technology and you can do it on time and on budget, and it will cost you a fraction of what it will cost you if you do it yourself and we&#8217;ll take a fraction of the amount of time as it would, if you would try it yourself. It&#8217;s quite a logical deduction, logically deducted way of selling what we have, but all of these things are true. And I think over time, the platform approach has already starting to become the method of choice for a lot of technology projects. Because it just it makes more sense to not try to do something somebody else&#8217;s clearly better positioned than you to do. So there&#8217;s less and less convincing or whatever we need to do. But the biggest blocker for us, the biggest competition for us, it&#8217;s not some other player. It&#8217;s the internal mindset of thinking that you could do this yourself. That&#8217;s the lever we need to pull and we need to push any to work on.<strong>Helene Panzarino: <\/strong>[00:25:12] I would a hundred percent agree with you and I think just stay with us as we move forward into other parts of Vacuumlabs, we&#8217;re going to be talking about partnerships. What successful, what happened? How do you go from a strategy for example, to an implementation and who can you work with along the way? I imagined for some people, they something gets landed on the table or on the desk and they say, we need this to happen or look into this. And they just don&#8217;t know who to turn to. It&#8217;s great when we have partnerships that work together in the same way that our two organizations work together. But I think with just the cloud was always the thing that was in the background as well. Putting people off working externally and looking at platforms. And now over the last three years, we see much more acceptance of that. And maybe that&#8217;ll be the thing that unlocks the door and opens it up for everyone to get on board because you&#8217;re right. It&#8217;s cheaper, it&#8217;s faster and it&#8217;s going to be a better product fit because you&#8217;re going to get the best in class of everything that you need plugging in for the purpose. So it&#8217;s logical that should happen in that way. I would say thank you very much to Nikolai Hack from Nucoro for joining us today.

And it leads on to others: will I need a banking license for my business? Or can I partner with another license holder? Some profitable market niches can fall outside of the regulatory regime. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s very important here to define which geographies you want to operate in; <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">it\u2019s tricky to pivot towards an international operation if your initial proposition solely relied on a domestic focus.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Different jurisdictions have very different regulatory regimes and in some markets, such as Malaysia and the Philippines, the costs and capital adequacy requirements are significantly lower for digital banking in comparison with other regional markets such Singapore and Hong Kong. These cost advantages are now driving some very rapid-paced growth in creating new digital banks in these lower-cost markets. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clarity of purpose<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is a fintech cornerstone for<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/uk.linkedin.com\/public-profile\/in\/neil-harris-8ab1515?challengeId=AQGTAPJTjWj0xAAAAXeVpvRPCthB5wuLus0plxy8tdJCx2k0EvGvkC1gePl8xViQ8uICQrDtKlyR7eM2edGAibT_91SBL6AE1A&amp;submissionId=13d69cb3-42f7-6216-763d-53125f055956\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neil Harris<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Group CCO of GPS.

Prioritize consumer outcomes: How does our product make someone better off and how are we increasing their financial well-being.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>This agility of response towards positive consumer outcomes was brought into sharp relief in April 2020 by Starling Bank who launched its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.starlingbank.com\/blog\/case-study-how-connected-card-can-help\/\">Connected<\/a> Debit Card for customers in vulnerable situations in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.<\/p>\n<h2><b>Prioritize recurring revenue streams<\/b><b>\u2014<\/b><b>pivot from interest income to service revenues<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Focusing on the bottom line is essential: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/manifestogrowth.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Manifesto Growth Architects<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2018 research shows that many are struggling to break even. In light of the current funding squeeze induced by low interest rates and the pandemic, fintechs need to focus on profitability. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/joanna-levesque-b1a0993\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joanna Levesque<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, who heads up Manifesto Growth Architects\u2019\u2019 financial services practice, stresses that challengers looking to scale should seek to \u2018move up the curve\u2019 in terms of service revenues: non-interest income and other fees and commissions. Of Starling, Revolut and Monzo, Starling has now been the first to report a profit; and its 2020 financial results already show a near 50\/50 split between interest and non-interest income.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Niche is the new mainstream<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The panel highlighted that a great deal of money can be eaten up in building a digital bank\u2019s \u2018community\u2019 from scratch, as evidenced by the US$497m of funding received to date by Monzo. It can be a much smarter proposition to tap into a community that already exists. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Until recently, some digital banks were targeting customers at a discount, for example via referrals, rather than seeking to acquire customers profitably\u2014and that\u2019s not a sustainable business model. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Given that it\u2019s now low-cost to acquire customer data,<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">successful fintechs will harness customer-focused metrics to understand how customers are behaving and prioritize content quality to drive engagement and community to increase return visits. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joanna says:<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;There&#8217;s the opportunity now to deliver personalized and real-time experience management, allowing customers to have very fluid personalized journeys offering contextual triggers at the right time, so that you can really respond to their behavior.

Nigel says, <\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIn the API-driven world, it\u2019s never been easier for a bank to spin up a new tech stack to support new services and \/ or new customer segments. API-driven means being customer-centric and services-centric, not product-centric. You can pull those things which are relevant to your customers and combine these with more traditional financial products. This significantly drives down the cost to serve each customer and it\u2019s now very easy to get started and companies like Vacuumlabs can package and assemble this for you into solutions.\u201d<i><br \/>\n<\/i><i><\/i><\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><i><br \/>\n<\/i>Leveraging the fintech ecosystem means you don\u2019t have to rebuild things that have already been built by others. You can channel your energy into focusing on those areas of your proposition that speak specifically to your client base or target demographic and where you are seeking to differentiate yourself in the marketplace. And, if you\u2019re a non-bank, all the heavy lifting has already been done for you. All the connectivity for the global infrastructure is available via Banking as a Service (BaaS) providers.<i><br \/>\n<\/i><i><br \/>\n<\/i>The primary tech build messages, then, are plain: don\u2019t build on an old chassis, start with a cloud-native approach, architect your solutions for the future and focus on your differentiators.

Monzo is valued at US$1.6bn on the back of total capital raised of US$497m; Revolut\u2019s valuation is US$5.5bn on the back of US$918m in funding. This equates to a valuation of US$3.2 per funding dollar for Monzo vs. US$6 for Revolut.<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are players who are specifically built to assist fintech launches\u2014so leverage the skills that are out there. Neil is clear on this matter: <\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My advice is to choose your partners wisely and insist upon reference points. Choose partners that are specific to your proposition and outsource. Outsourcing has significant advantages. You&#8217;re not just buying the service, you&#8217;re buying the people and the expertise that can help accelerate your business growth, so you have fewer distractions and keep on track. You\u2019ll be at a higher bar for regulatory compliance and you can remain nimble whilst you focus on your proposition and delivering value to your customers.\u201d<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2><b>Bringing it all together<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">S<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">oftware partners are often approached by would-be market entrants and asked to replicate the superficial branding characteristics of a specific unicorn.

And, in parallel, we work with you on proposition development, identifying the key technologies you&#8217;re going to need, and then these two dovetails: by the time you&#8217;re regulatory approved you&#8217;ve got the first versions of the tech product built and you&#8217;re in the market.\u201d<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Panel chair <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/uk.linkedin.com\/in\/helene-panzarino\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Helene Panzarino<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> summarized the way forward by emphasizing that the successful fintechs of the future <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">will be built around data insight-led<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">communities served by authentic personalized propositions.

That\u2019s because SMBs have traditionally been viewed as having much of the same complexity as large-scale business customers but are overall, less profitable as customers, being tough to acquire and with churn rates approaching those of retail. Yet much of this banking landscape could well be about to change as we found out from our Banking on Air podcast guest Anthony Strike, CEO of US-based <a href=\"https:\/\/steadipay.com\/\">SteadiPay<\/a>. SteadiPay began life as a personal finance app designed to set aside funds to offset money spent on an individual\u2019s credit card. In designing the initial app, Anthony and his wife wanted to take advantage of all the rewards that came with using their credit card but needed, likewise, to know that they were always fully on top of their spending. Shortly after bringing the product out they began to get enquiries from SMBs for whom effective cash flow management is critical:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\r\n<p>\u201cCashflow is the lifeblood of a small business and understanding how many dollars are moving in and out of your business is the most important thing you need to do as a small business owner. But it&#8217;s also not remotely why you got into business and it&#8217;s also a big manual chore.\u201d &#8211; Anthony Strike<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Anthony wanted to take much of that weight off the shoulders of small business owners.<\/strong> He initially hit a few roadblocks when initially scaling up the business realizing it was nowhere near as easy to secure the technology providers to build the product as he had first envisioned. The app needed to enable SMBs to assess their cash position real-time, forecast cash flow and also optimize cash holdings by securing superior money market rates without the need to swap banks. Searching for technology service providers he and his team learnt firsthand about the challenges and limitations of the BaaS space:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\r\n<p>\u201cAs a FinTech, I&#8217;m dependent on my banking as a service platform and my banking relationships and I can only innovate to the extent that they innovate. I can only bring products to market that they have capabilities for. And that&#8217;s why I think you see a ton of the neobanks being relatively undifferentiated on product because it&#8217;s very hard to create something when all of them have some banking as a service platforms operating underneath.\u201d &#8211; Anthony Strike<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>And according to Anthony, this remains a key reason why small and medium-sized enterprises in the US is so underbanked:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\r\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u00a0 less about them not having a bank and more about them not having access to tools to really grow and improve their business from the places they do bank.\u201c &#8211; Anthony Strike<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>How was SteadiPay able to build its offering and begin to offer SMBs these services? SteadiPay partnered directly with a bank and was able to create its own internal BaaS platform to manage ledgers and transactions. For critical elements of the technology build, SteadiPay did not have the ability to build this in-house, so the company partnered with Vacuumlabs.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\r\n<p>\u201cWe found a partner that has expertise in building these really critical heavy-lift things that we need to build right now. We did not have direct experience building this, but we knew we had to and<strong> Vacuumlabs was an excellent fit\u2014like a hand in a glove when it came to<\/strong> <strong>delivery.<\/strong>\u201d &#8211; Anthony Strike<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Anthony talked about the culture of old-school community banks in the US and how these institutions were able to offer a highly-personalized service that understood the all intricacies of the customer\u2019s business, therefore they could recommend products that really fitted the bill for that particular customer\u2019s needs. For Anthony merely delivering the data and providing a snapshot is just the starting point:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\r\n<p>\u201cThere are a lot of forecasting tools that there&#8217;s a lot of things that help the customer see their data. But that should be the starting point for the small business where you understand their current cash situation and data or financial needs. And you don&#8217;t just dump a forecast on them and say, okay, here&#8217;s your data, go figure out what you need to do. They need help\u2014like the community banker would do in the past.\u201d- Anthony Strike<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>To find out more about scaling up their business and the reality of SMB space, listen to our new Banking on Air podcast episode featuring Anthony Strike of Steadipay \u2013 Available on<a href=\"https:\/\/podcasts.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/inside-the-vacuum\/id1505101625?ign-mpt=uo%3D4\"> <strong>Apple Podcasts<\/strong><\/a>,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.breaker.audio\/inside-the-vacuum\"> <strong>Breaker<\/strong><\/a>,<a href=\"https:\/\/podcasts.google.com\/?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy8xODhkNTE2OC9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw%3D%3D\"> <strong>Google Podcasts<\/strong><\/a>,<a href=\"https:\/\/overcast.fm\/itunes1505101625\/inside-the-vacuum\"> <strong>Overcast<\/strong><\/a>,<a href=\"https:\/\/pca.st\/jdvlp9mq\"> <strong>Pocket Casts<\/strong><\/a>,<a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/show\/2wKh1nEPsvZfJc8nZFBFah\"> <strong>Spotify<\/strong><\/a> or here:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"post__player player\"><iframe border=\"0\" class=\"player__iframe\" src=\"https:\/\/anchor.fm\/insidethevacuum\/embed\/episodes\/25-SMB-acceleration-in-the-US-with-Anthony-Strike-SteadiPay-eq5ea6\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" scrolling=\"no\" frameBorder=\"0\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n\r\n\r\n\t\n\t<div id=\"podcast-subscribe-button-3988\" class=\"secondline-psb-radius-style\">\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n<div class=\"secondline-psb-subscribe-icons\" style=\"margin-top:-2em;margin-bottom:1em;\"><strong>WHERE TO LISTEN<\/strong> &nbsp;

At Vacuumlabs, a solution-based tech powerhouse, we believe that the future is in communities when it comes to digital transformation and financial services. If you&#8217;re interested in hearing more about FinTech, digital banking or payments, please don&#8217;t hesitate to subscribe or to attend one of our virtual events.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As ever I&#8217;m not alone on this podcast. And on this episode, I am delighted to say that I have two co-hosts&nbsp; or guests with me. I&#8217;m joined by Michael Callas, who&#8217;s the Chief Strategy Officer at Vacuumlabs and leading the charge in the United States and Anthony Strike, who&#8217;s the founder of SteadiPay who&#8217;s based in the United States. We have a bit of a flavor, as you can hear to this episode, we&#8217;re taking it home. So exactly so that we can spend more time talking about some of the amazing things that we&#8217;re doing in the United States. Michael, I&#8217;m going to ask you if you&#8217;ll start off our podcast today and introduce Anthony and get us rolling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michael Callas\u00a0 <\/strong>[00:01:06] You\u00a0 got it boss. Great to be with you,\u00a0 Helene, I&#8217;m an avid subscriber of course, and<s> <\/s>love the work that you&#8217;re doing with us.\u00a0 So Anthony and I are friends. We met a few years back now in LA at a party for Greek entrepreneurs, right Anthony?\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anthony Strike <\/strong>[00:01:20] That is right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michael Callas&nbsp; <\/strong>[00:01:21] And I think that after the<s> <\/s>&nbsp;14th or 15th bottle of wine was opened, you and I went off to a corner. And <s>&nbsp;<\/s>we were debating the pros and cons of banking as a service in the US and how much needs to be accomplished there.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anthony Strike [1:40] <\/strong>We were the only two FinTech people I think there that night. It was definitely an interesting&nbsp; scene and a lot of fun.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michael Callas&nbsp; <\/strong>[00:01:44]You&#8217;re so right. And I remember back almost a decade when I first met Helene Panzarino. Remember Helene? In our early twenties. And<s> <\/s>we&#8217;ve had an amazing conversation about my grandmother&#8217;s credit union in Brownsville, Texas. Remember I told you the story, right? That, I remember going to the bank as a kid and my grandmother was a teacher for 37 years in Brownsville. And<s> <\/s>she went to the Brownsville Teacher&#8217;s Credit Union.<s> <\/s>And the same woman had been her banker her entire career,<s> <\/s>Gloria Villegas. I think that what the small bank, what that credit union kind of energy can bring to an entrepreneur looking to scale is a reminder of why we do what we do, why we serve our communities and then the age of digital. Our communities are everywhere. <s>&nbsp;<\/s>So therefore it&#8217;s even more imperative to stay focused <s>&nbsp;<\/s>on that customer centricity.&nbsp; <s>&nbsp;<\/s>And that&#8217;s really exciting. And actually, Anthony, that leads me to asking you to tell us a little bit about SteadiPay and your journey.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anthony Strike <\/strong>[00:02:32] Sure! Our journey has been a winding one. SteadiPay started<s> <\/s>as a personal finance app. It was born out of my wife and I just sucking at budgeting and wondering every month, what the hell we spent all this money on credit cards? <s>&nbsp;<\/s>And in fact, my wife made the comment to me one month. She said, it&#8217;s just so easy to swipe a card and worry about paying it off later. I&nbsp; wish the money came out of our account right away. I thought, yeah, but you could just use the debit card,&nbsp; <s>&nbsp;<\/s>being a good husband and just of course, finding a solution immediately.&nbsp; <s>&nbsp;<\/s>And she said, no, you wouldn&#8217;t get the rewards, went to London for free on the miles last year and I&#8217;d like to get the rewards, but not have to worry about tracking how much I&#8217;m spending and worrying about some big payment at the end of the month, surprising us. We were reasonable users of our card. We paid our bill off in full every month, but it just felt like, this thing was sneak attacking us each month.&nbsp; That solution didn&#8217;t exist in the market as that I was aware of and I decided to go build it. So <s>&nbsp;<\/s>we built this tool to let you, as you spent money on your card, we pulled funds aside and paid it down for you and made sure you didn&#8217;t overspend, but still earned your rewards. That was a nice little product, but two things happened simultaneously. Number one, we got to a few thousand users and we started hearing from a number of our customers who were small business owners asking if they could use the card on their small business finances.&nbsp; And this was really curious to us. It didn&#8217;t jive with the initial reason that we had built up the product we thought, why would a business want to pay sooner? They seems like they&#8217;d want to pay later. But the truth was that managing cash and the timing of cash and your card limit and all this were these complex, annoying things that small business owners didn&#8217;t want to have to manually manage. And it was our first little clue into just how many manual processes and legacy technologies and friction points, a small business owner has to deal with&nbsp; in just managing finances.&nbsp; <s>&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/s>Cashflow is the lifeblood of a small business and understanding how many dollars are moving in and out of your business is the most important thing you need to do as a small business owner. But it&#8217;s also not remotely why you got into business and it&#8217;s also a big manual chore.&nbsp; So it has this challenge of this cashflow management has this challenge of being so critical, but so far away from what the business owner wants to do, and also being so much work. And that became a real<s> <\/s>obvious opportunity for us to take the technology we&#8217;d built and pivoted over to support small businesses. <s>&nbsp;<\/s>The second thing that happened was we started to really get firsthand <s>&nbsp;<\/s>understanding of just how freaking expensive it is to scale a B2C finance app if you didn&#8217;t hear on blocks. So we really had no qualms and jumping ship on that growth route and have not looked back since starting to focus on this new direction. It&#8217;s been very, it has been a very wise company saving pivot.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michael Callas&nbsp; <\/strong>[00:05:06] It&#8217;s marvelous.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino <\/strong>[00:05:07] Could you mind if I ask a question at this point on that onto ?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michael Callas&nbsp; <\/strong>[00:05:11] It&#8217;s your show Helene.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino <\/strong>[00:05:12] It is my show&#8230; Listening to you, Anthony, I&#8217;m thinking about how many&#8230; <s>&nbsp;<\/s>&nbsp;I&#8217;m always working with FinTech, the fintechs, whether that was on a program before helping them raise finance and every conversation where you&#8217;d say, listen, B2C is going to be really tough. So that, 400 million or that much money you&#8217;re going to have to get in there to build up the community and get things going. Think hard about it. Particularly now, where early stage funding becomes more difficult and later stage financing in this current uncertain situation is a bit easier. And secondly, that B2B solution,&nbsp; there&#8217;s something in a founder&#8217;s mind that makes it harder to do the pivot because you&#8217;re, I guess,<s> <\/s>because you&#8217;re passionate about the group that you set out to work within the first place, right? In this case, it was you and your wife, you know what I mean?&nbsp; Know, you said you realized that it was a lot easier to scale it, but there must have been one of these moments where like we&#8217;re not raising finance or we\u2019re going to struggle before we get anywhere to break. Even before you even start talking to a bank about licensing or anything else.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anthony Strike <\/strong>[00:06:10] <s>&nbsp;<\/s>Yes. So the pivot to move to small businesses, I&#8217;m not sure we were convinced so it would be easier to scale, but we probably thought it might at least be more cash efficient . <s>&nbsp;<\/s>There&#8217;s a lot of other challenges involved in small businesses. And in fact, the financial tools targeted at SMBs, especially the smaller side of SMBs, that&#8217;s a pretty new space evolving. In the past ,&nbsp; most of the FinTech tools that have hit the market with a few notable exceptions, like bill.com have really been pushed to the extremes because of business model temptation. When you look at consumer, Yeah, it&#8217;s the margins suck it&#8217;s hard, the pure scale of it is appealing. So rather than go chase a few million small businesses, you can go chase tens of millions of consumers and small businesses to be frank,&nbsp; it&#8217;s not much easier to acquire them than it is retail customers, and they don&#8217;t churn much less. You get in some way of looking at it the worst of both worlds, you get the worst of consumer with the complexity of the business scale.&nbsp; So a lot of businesses say I&#8217;m just going to focus on the consumer plus you have a lot of founders coming at it from their own personal pain points, like I was instinctually jumped into a consumer solution. On the other side, it&#8217;s just a lot more appealing to go chase a big enterprise customer, where if you land one deal that can get you your funding round and if you land three more, that can land you the next funding round and a few more and you can be profitable. <s>&nbsp;<\/s>Now landing those deals with that, of course can be insanely hard, but that just means that a lot of businesses looked at SMB and said, wow, it&#8217;s got the hard&nbsp; sales cycles of potentially SMB and annoying churn problems and acquisition issues that you face in retail. So why would we spend time here? <s>&nbsp;<\/s>But the truth is that some of the technology advancements that have happened recently, some of the go to market strategies that have emerged have made it so that <s>&nbsp;<\/s>targeting SMBs is I think a really good business.&nbsp; <s>&nbsp;<\/s>And you let one group get far enough behind in technology solutions and eventually the demand is going to make it worthwhile to solve this problem. All that has played a role in making SMB a much more interesting space to play right now, but still, it&#8217;s still hard.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino<\/strong>[00:08:05] it&#8217;s a space which is obviously close to my heart. I mean, my own personal journey in helping just over 20,000 companies raise finance in the last 20 odd years means to me that they&#8217;re very precious to me, which is the other reason that I liked the smaller banks, because I think this is their moment with them as well. And having had four of my own companies and done a couple of exits, I feel the other side of it also. I wanted to ask you,&nbsp; we can talk about the pandemic bringing SMEs, SMBs to the fore because the community banks were able to get a lot of the money from the stimulus packages into the accounts of the SMBs, probably 9 billion. The first 9 billion came out of the Midwest and to SMB accounts in the first<s> <\/s>&nbsp;lockdown that we had. So again, do you feel like this is a moment for these banks to be able to engage much more genuinely and on a longer-term basis with this community in the way you&#8217;ve experienced working with them?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anthony Strike <\/strong>[00:08:58] I would really love to say yes, but frankly,&nbsp; the COVID related stimulus packages are probably a one-time blip that worked, meaningfully changed banking relationships between small businesses and banks. <s>&nbsp;<\/s>I think most small businesses got money from banks where they already had a relationship, or if they did get it through a channel that they are a bank that they weren&#8217;t already having a relationship, I don&#8217;t think that was enough to make them fully switch their accounts. I think it might help a few banks here and there gained some customers, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a sustainable change or shift in those relationships, which is too bad because community banks really went too bad for small businesses in this case. <s>&nbsp;<\/s>But ultimately, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to be a meaningful shift,&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino <\/strong>[00:09:37] So interesting and one of the reasons I think that&#8230;&nbsp; One of the outcomes let&#8217;s say, or one of the things that was highlighted, a weakness that was highlighted, was there the clunkiness of engaging with a smaller bank on the UX side, but then in other areas. Now you as a founder made the decision to work with another FinTech, for example, with us,&nbsp; in building out as you were going to scale and we see a resistance, so we have seen a resistance in some of the smaller financial institutions and other credit unions to take that leap of faith to make that step to work FinTech to FinTech. So I&#8217;m curious to see from your perspective, at what point did you realize that you had to get some outside help or that it would be a good idea and how did you have the conversation with yourself that said, it&#8217;s okay to let go and to get some external assistance as I scale?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anthony Strike <\/strong>[00:10:27] We were under no delusions at any point that we were going to be able to handle this all on our own. Without getting too long key on particular banking as a service platforms and what all that is. When we were in BKC, we were facing a choice about a new product launch that we had to go through and particularly we wanted to launch a high yield <s>&nbsp;<\/s>&nbsp;bank agnostic sweep account for small businesses. We wanted to be able to let small businesses put any cash they had on hand to use even for a short amount of time, even for a small amount of dollars and get the best rate on the market without having to switch banks without having to navigate a bunch of tech. We made&nbsp; a really simple bank agnostic sweep account, but we needed a bank partner that we could sweep those funds to who would give us a high yield rate and <s>&nbsp;<\/s>we learned firsthand about the challenge of the banking as a service space, which is that if you or me as a FinTech, I&#8217;m dependent on a company like,&nbsp; Synapse for <s>&nbsp;<\/s>my banking as a service platforms and my banking relationships, then I can only innovate to the extent that they innovate. I can only bring products to market that they have capabilities for. And that&#8217;s why I think you see a ton of the neobanks be relatively undifferentiated on product. It\u2019s because it&#8217;s very hard to create something when all of them have some banking as a service platform operating underneath, but with relatively few exceptions. So we couldn&#8217;t get a banking as a service provider to give us a rate that would be meaningfully differentiated. So we started to look for a new bank partner on this front and this actually, this has a story that speaks to your point about community banks, being a little unwilling to work directly with fintechs. We talked to tons of banks. And we got so close, so many of them, but they just couldn&#8217;t pull the trigger on saying, Oh, you know what? We feel comfortable engaging with you directly, rather than having some banking as a service provider, handle all the ledgering and KYC and all that stuff that we feel comfortable with, not to file generation, all those annoying things. Right around the same time we discovered Move <s>&nbsp;<\/s>move.io, which is an open source notch resource that<s> <\/s>Wade and team have been building for awhile. And at the time it was relatively unknown.&nbsp; but someone we met through NBC Casey actually introduced us to it. And that gave us a tool to start managing, not to files an ACH generation ourselves, if we could find a bank partner that would partner directly with us. So we&#8217;d solve one portion of the banking as a service problem, but now we just needed a bank that was willing to do it.&nbsp; And this is where the other side of it comes in, sometimes it&#8217;s better to be lucky than good.&nbsp; <s>&nbsp;<\/s>My co-founder Chad, who is a wonderful guy <s>&nbsp;<\/s>has a good relationship because his kids play with the kids of the head of treasury at Axos bank. so we were able to go to Axos bank<s> <\/s>and have a conversation with someone that it would have taken us a long, long time to have a conversation with without that relationship.&nbsp; <s>&nbsp;<\/s>And as a result of that, we were able to get access, to sign on to support this product and so through move, we were able to create our own&nbsp; essentially internal banking as a service platform to<s> <\/s>&nbsp;manage ledgers, manage not-to-file generation, do all of our KYC. We partner with alloy on that front. We partnered with the VGs to manage <s>&nbsp;<\/s>a lot of the security stuff and we pieced together these different vendors that could produce Our own solution here, but that&#8217;s a heavy lift, especially on the ledger side, especially, understanding the critical nature, all this data that is a really heavy lift. For as much as time as we&#8217;ve spent in this industry, we did not feel like we have the ability to just tell any old developer how to do this. It was right around that time that we were talking with Michael and Matej about your guys&#8217; capabilities, your experience in the FinTech space, your knowledge, your experience having specifically built out ledger management software. It was really a fit that had hit that right time and it was just a great fit where we said, okay<s> ,&nbsp; <\/s>we found a partner that has expertise in building these really critical heavy lift things that we need to build right now.&nbsp; <s>&nbsp;<\/s>So anyway, that&#8217;s a long way of saying we did not feel like we could build this, but we knew we had to and<s> <\/s>without making this too salesy and pitchy and advertising with Vacuumlabs, it was like a hand in a glove or glove on the hand for us when it came to delivering on that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michael Callas&nbsp; <\/strong>[00:14:16] Checks in the mail. Anthony, thank you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think I remember exactly the meeting that we had at Money2020.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anthony Strike <\/strong>[00:14:26] We were sitting in what was it, yardbird across the street, across the way from that place in Venetian, where everybody walks in and out?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michael Callas&nbsp; <\/strong>[00:14:33] It was insanity. And I remember what was the Mexican joint. I forgot which one it was, but I remember we had the nachos and basically Matej and I&nbsp; just ate, while you draw what you needed. We can do that.&nbsp; I think that you&#8217;re a great match for us because you challenged us.&nbsp; <s>&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/s>We don\u2019t really know how to do stuff. We know how to do stuff that\u2019s qoute unquote simple. <s>&nbsp;<\/s>But when our engineers can be challenged, then everybody&#8217;s one.&nbsp; I think that&#8217;s why we stay very boutique and that way we can focus on folks like you that have a vision <s>&nbsp;<\/s>that can&#8217;t be delivered by the existing platforms out there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anthony Strike <\/strong>[00:15:09] Yeah, right? Yeah. that was our concern with most of the other shops we talked to is that they were really going to be learning this almost behind learning curve from us. And that was a little nerve wracking to sign a deal for that. And so the fact that you guys had some expertise in places that we didn&#8217;t get the straight, I think I walked out of that meeting and went right over to Donald Hawkins, and now he&#8217;s got his own neobank going back. I walked over. You got to talk to these guys and if I remember right, you guys ended up working together too, right?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michael Callas <\/strong>[00:15:34] A little bit. Yeah. You&#8217;re good. We love, yeah. We love, think his vision for banking, his community is spectacular.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anthony Strike <\/strong>[00:15:41] They\u2019re doing great job.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michael Callas&nbsp; <\/strong>[00:15:41] They are. Anthony. I don&#8217;t know if I would take a step back because Helene and I are both lovers of banking as a service.<s> <\/s>My own ship of banking as a service goes back to BBA banking in Spain, right? Like I&#8217;ve been, I feel like I&#8217;d been rooting for this industry for a very long time. <s>&nbsp;<\/s>Really in my late twenties. <s>&nbsp;<\/s>And, I&#8217;m curious, do you think that a platform can be built for the US to actually service founders like you? Or is the mix of existing platforms and kind of<s> <\/s>a really good, engineering team to kind of put it all together the solution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anthony Strike <\/strong>[00:16:13] What I would love to see in market and maybe if SteadiPay just totally craps out<s> <\/s>I&#8217;ll try to build this if it&#8217;s not in the market yet.But what I would love to see&#8230;With you of course <s>&nbsp;<\/s>&nbsp;What I would love to see<s> <\/s>is a marketplace for different financial tools for a Fintech to build.&nbsp; Right now, if you go to Synapse, you are locked in on Synapse and if you go to<s> <\/s>Q2you&#8217;re locked in with Q2 and there&#8217;s not a lot of picking and choosing what you want and I&#8217;ll use an analogy. So like&nbsp; what Alloy is doing with KYC and KYB, they&#8217;re bringing together a bunch of different vendors, they&#8217;re applying, some leverage at scale to get deals that make it at least cost neutral for new customers and making the KYC KYB, a one-stop shop thing. I think there&#8217;s going to be real opportunity for that with specific financial tools. And I think there&#8217;s going to be enough community banks willing to provide these ala cart services <s>&nbsp;<\/s>that would pipe into a marketplace like this, that a Fintech could be focused on <s>&nbsp;<\/s>just providing really good UX for its customers and then on the back-end, you could see 5, 6, 10, 15 different banks plugging into different elements of this. Now there&#8217;s friction here because no bank wants to just make itself dump pipes, especially one single dumb pipe for one single product. But I don&#8217;t know that they&#8217;re going to have a choice because there are enough small banks out there who are willing to lend their charter in order to stay alive and relevant and maintain you know access to customers that you could probably piece together <s>&nbsp;<\/s>10 community banks that would be willing to provide different financial services on an Alla cart basis and allow a FinTech to build a really more customized platform. <s>&nbsp;<\/s>And<s> <\/s>that&#8217;s what we were gone with. <s>&nbsp;<\/s>Move, I think it could be a huge. facilitator of this and they just raised some crazy money from some great investors and are really going to be putting some cool stuff out there in the market with ledger management software and things like that, that they don&#8217;t have out there yet.&nbsp; That&#8217;s where I think the opportunity is.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino <\/strong>[00:18:03] On, along that line. and I would agree with you and I think that&#8217;s not, probably not too far off in the future in the US. What&#8217;s do you feel the role of regulation and regulators? Where we&#8217;re in the transition now obviously we&#8217;ve now Brooks is not with the OCC anymore. Jelena McWilliams at the FDIC is only there until 2023, but we do have this now listing that the FDA has put out if you&#8217;re on the list, then, you can, if you&#8217;re a smaller bank, you can be reasonably assured that you&#8217;ve passed a few tests as it were to engage. Will regulation like open banking, which is now seeping in everywhere else as well have an impact on that concept that you just explained?&nbsp; <s>&nbsp;<\/s><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anthony Strike <\/strong>[00:18:40] I&#8217;m sure it will. I frankly just would need to do a little more research on what the technological implications are of this sort of marketplace approach. Before I had a real intelligent answer for you there. &nbsp; <s>&nbsp;<\/s>I think open banking is if it&#8217;s going to&nbsp; look like it does in the US like it does in Europe, it&#8217;s going to be, it&#8217;s going to be a long time before that happens.<s> <\/s>I think we&#8217;re much more likely to see large banks&nbsp; getting their APIs polished up and owning this themselves and some technology providers building on top of that.&nbsp; <s>&nbsp;<\/s>I can see alternatives to plaid coming in that are more<s> <\/s>&nbsp;friendly to the banking APIs. I can see a lot of stuff happening that facilitates this, but from a regulatory perspective, I just think they&#8217;re going to be playing catch up the whole way. So I don&#8217;t, I really don&#8217;t know.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michael Callas&nbsp; <\/strong>[00:19:24] I agree Helene.<s> <\/s>I think, in Europe, obviously we live through, the UK decided to make all the back to the standard<s> <\/s>all these things, right.<s>&nbsp; <\/s>And even now we&#8217;re still waiting for banks to catch up, some of them. <s>&nbsp;<\/s>While some have been trailblazers, be the among of them. I think that the thing I love about our homeland kids, is that it&#8217;s industry demanding this.&nbsp; <s>&nbsp;<\/s>And so<s> <\/s>it&#8217;s<s> <\/s>capitalism at its best and needs to catch up with these needs. And it more to the point, I think, the marketplace is dreadfully in need of innovative products.I think that we&#8217;re going through the obvious Robin Hood moment that has been an absolute shock to watch.&nbsp; <s>&nbsp;<\/s>All this stuff happening. honestly, it&#8217;s what the hell?&nbsp; I\u2019m on the board of FELS Group out of Frankfurt, Germany. A similar platform to Robinhood, however BaFin certified (the German regulator), right? So playing by the rules, there is just,&nbsp; absolutely how it&#8217;s built.&nbsp; I think about the underserved population of SMEs and in the States, <s>&nbsp;<\/s>that is an important contingent.&nbsp; I think that we need to respond better and that&#8217;s certainly a big reason why we&#8217;re focusing so much on the Americas at Vacuumlabs. I have always said I&#8217;m going to go home and do something special.&nbsp; <s>&nbsp;<\/s>and some COVID slowed that down a bit.&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to be there, and yeah. Anthony, obviously part of our, we&#8217;re investors in your company, we believe firmly in what you&#8217;re doing and your insights are really interesting <s>&nbsp;<\/s>&nbsp;because we&#8217;re in a bubble in Europe, in Asia, Asia is open banking. It&#8217;s nuts. It&#8217;s amazing what we can do in Asia.&nbsp; <s>&nbsp;<\/s>The most important capitalist country in the world needs to catch up or set or begin to set the standards.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anthony Strike <\/strong>[00:20:53] It&#8217;s a good example of <s>&nbsp;<\/s>the capitalism can create its own problems of course. a lot of the issues that are here are being driven by the fact that regulators didn&#8217;t get involved earlier and let capitalism <s>&nbsp;<\/s>run its course. <s>&nbsp;<\/s>But we&#8217;re here now, and this is where we are. I think,&nbsp; as a FinTech founder, trying to build things where I&#8217;m not beholden to some banking as a service provider that&#8217;s going to limit me, I&#8217;m invested in seeing tools come to market that regulators<s> <\/s>&nbsp;view as giving flexibility and access <s>&nbsp;<\/s>rather than limiting those things. I think what I&#8217;m talking about as far as marketplace for, financial tools and<s> <\/s>Plugging into more APIs and broadening that is access friendly, and regulators would generally like that but who knows what we&#8217;ll see where it goes&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michael Callas <\/strong>[00:21:35] Transparent and accessible to them. Those are the two sort of pieces that really just love.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anthony Strike <\/strong>[00:21:39] For us in America is that, anything that helps small businesses, it has just immediate momentum behind it when it comes to government and regulatory stuff. I think as we can generate proof that this FinTech stuff is meaningfully helping small businesses <s>&nbsp;<\/s>that will really help our case. Now a lot of small business financial tools are really nascent and so that, real proof is&nbsp; not there yet, but it&#8217;s going to get there and I think that will really support it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino <\/strong>[00:22:02] It&#8217;s a really good point as well because sitting on this side where we&#8217;ve been doing this for a few years and with the advent of open banking in 2018, you almost ask yourself, is it a fad? How many SME banks, how many neobanks, how many challenger banks can you spin out for SMEs? Do you go very niche and become: I&#8217;m the supply chain bank for this SME fashion industry. Where do you draw the line in that way? And then as an owner, how do I distinguish as an SMB owner, which way I&#8217;m going to go and will that create too much choice create paralysis. I always say this when I&#8217;m home, I go down the salad dressing aisle in the supermarket, and I come out with oil and vinegar. Cause I&#8217;m so confused. I just revert back to what I know. So there&#8217;s a danger of having too much choice, having it become almost<s> <\/s>superficial and net without a voice of authenticity, which means that SMB owner won&#8217;t move to that offering. So learn from the mistakes here. <s>&nbsp;<\/s><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anthony Strike <\/strong>[00:22:58] I think there&#8217;s a couple of things that I&#8217;m going to try to talk through without making myself sound like an idiot.&nbsp; First of all, I think that the niche thing is a question of<s> <\/s>how many are venture backable? That&#8217;s one separate question because I don&#8217;t, I think, no, not many. I think even the ones that have been venture backed, you&#8217;re going to struggle to make the returns that they want to make. But however, I think there&#8217;s, as the cost of starting a quote unquote, Neobank or a financial services company goes way, way, way, way down. I mean like exponentially lower than it was 10 years ago. It will become increasingly easier to build a niche financial services provider, whether you will call it a neobank or an embedded finance provider or something, but very niche, maybe it only offers one or two basic services that a particular vertical needs. Look at the creator economy and influencers. Their banking needs are fairly limited and focused. It&#8217;s in this weird blurry range between small business and individual. And there are a number of really cool <s>&nbsp;<\/s>companies. I hesitate to call them neobanks, but companies popping up that offer financial services in that exact space. I think that you could start to see a world where there are a lot very niche, financial services, providers functioning as a sort of defacto bank for specific verticals that just offer exactly what that vertical needs.&nbsp; <s>&nbsp;<\/s>And then you&#8217;ll inevitably see the great bundling. So we&#8217;re in the unbundling phase here on financial services where things are getting niche and then there&#8217;ll be some rebundling but I think in the near term, the cost of creating financial services or embedding financial services is getting to the point where it&#8217;s almost&nbsp; like not like starting a website, but not that far off.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michael Callas&nbsp; <\/strong>[00:24:33] No, I think you&#8217;re right. I think you&#8217;re totally right.&nbsp; Like a lot of these niche banks, right, <s>&nbsp;<\/s>the marketing and the approach to the community<s> <\/s>is great, but I don&#8217;t see what&#8217;s under the hood that actually differentiates it. <s>&nbsp;<\/s>So if you&#8217;re trying to go after underserved communities, <s>&nbsp;<\/s>And your KYC provider kept,&nbsp; basically get anybody approved for the platform, you&#8217;re basically just doing nothing.&nbsp; <s>&nbsp;<\/s>You&#8217;re getting people&#8217;s hopes up. <s>&nbsp;<\/s>And they&#8217;ll be right back by the prepaid card at Walgreen, which defeats the entire purpose. <s>&nbsp;<\/s>I think that we&#8217;re, the US has got a whole lot sharper is working with companies that understand how to solve those niche problems. And those are things happening around the world.&nbsp; If you just look to Thailand, <s>&nbsp;<\/s>or Indonesia, how they&#8217;re solving these, Bangladesh.&nbsp; <s>&nbsp;<\/s>And I think,&nbsp; more of what&#8217;s happening in the guts of these neobanks needs to be really understood properly and solved because we can solve any problem or almost any problem with technology. <s>&nbsp;<\/s>And I think that enough there&#8217;s on a focus here on understanding how data identification, how that actually works. If I can bank from zero 38000 people in Thailand, <s>&nbsp;<\/s>and they have a 4%<s> <\/s>&nbsp;monthly payment rates,&nbsp; <s>&nbsp;<\/s>How can I not use that, those same tools to go after parts of the States that are underbanked? Right? or unbanked. So to me, I think we need to do a better job as an American sort of FinTech. <s>&nbsp;<\/s>family actually know families artists functional teams, <s>&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/s>but actually look at how the rest of us are solving these problems because <s>&nbsp;<\/s>they&#8217;re not insurmountable . <s>&nbsp;<\/s>Whoever does that stuff first will actually win the Bendigo bank game.&nbsp; <s>&nbsp;<\/s>Not just trying to go after the easily KYC,&nbsp; folks with jobs. that&#8217;s simple. Yeah.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anthony Strike <\/strong>[00:26:09] <s>&nbsp;<\/s>We really don&#8217;t need any more high net worth individual financial tools that has been solved. <s>&nbsp;<\/s>The challenges of underserved communities are pretty widely discussed in the FinTech space at this point. And<s>, <\/s>I&#8217;m by no means an expert there, but I can talk about some of the customers we have, they&#8217;re small businesses who,<s>&nbsp; <\/s>we have not had very many issues with<s> <\/s>&nbsp;validation of customers. There&#8217;s a whole separate ball game of&nbsp; these people don&#8217;t even have banks and dealing with people who are in that group for us. And we&#8217;re talking about small businesses,&nbsp; it&#8217;s a question of.<s> <\/s>what are they currently using? What are the tools that they need? And what does quote-unquote under-banked look like. An under-banked small business is someone who&#8217;s just keeping a bunch of their cash in their Venmo account or their PayPal account or the Stripe account. And are those tools giving them the flexibility they need to grow their business?&nbsp; <s>&nbsp;<\/s>A lot of companies out there that <s>&nbsp;<\/s>we talk to our doing decent amounts of revenue and it&#8217;s just <s>&nbsp;<\/s>sitting there in those types of accounts.&nbsp; If all you&#8217;re doing is letting someone deposit and withdraw cash<s> <\/s>that&#8217;s fine. But if you start talking about how do we lend to these companies? How should we give them merchant cash advances? Should it be term loans?<s> <\/s>What&#8217;s the right solution in lending there? Now you get into these new questions of underwriting and how can we underwrite in a way that doesn&#8217;t put the individual at risk, but also keeps risk off&nbsp; the company&#8217;s balance sheet. And that&#8217;s where I think<s> <\/s>our industry has a lot of work to still do<s>, <\/s>to solve the quote unquote underbanked part of SMBs. Less about them not having a bank and more about them not having access to tools to really grow and improve their business from the places they do bank.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michael Callas&nbsp; <\/strong>[00:27:36] It&#8217;s almost like a complete circle then Anthony to what we said earlier about the small bank approach <s>&nbsp;<\/s>brings us full circle because we&#8217;re talking about how those smaller banks<s> <\/s>have that personal touch. <s>&nbsp;<\/s>And what you&#8217;re basically trying to do is to extend that personal touch to a wider network of SMEs, <s>&nbsp;<\/s>Where in the old days, or, 10, 15 years ago, you walk into your small bank, <s>&nbsp;<\/s>and you had a conversation, with the banker, <s>&nbsp;<\/s>with your hometown banker.&nbsp; <s>&nbsp;<\/s>I think it&#8217;s where like the best digital, right? Is actually digital touching, <s>&nbsp;<\/s>Is actually the closeness. And that&#8217;s a fascinating bit. You know, team that actually brings us full circle, to the comment that I think Helene made earlier about sort of community banks and,<s>&nbsp; <\/s>being that high touch,&nbsp; very personal connection with you and your business. Anthony? I think we&#8217;ve talked about this more than once.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anthony Strike<\/strong>[00:28:24] Yeah. What a lot of community banks differentiate themselves on is that relationship they have with the business. They know the intricacies of the business, they know the family and community and dynamics and all of that. <s>&nbsp;<\/s>But ultimately what that&#8217;s for is about making sure you have the right financial tools.&nbsp; That relationship is meant to deliver, okay, this kind of loan is better for you than that kind of loan. And so what we&#8217;re trying to find is the chance to tell a small business, here&#8217;s what your cash looks like, here&#8217;s what&#8217;s going to happen in the future. Really understand that and then have the type of insight that community bank could have to point you toward the right financial solutions. We did more than 300 customer interviews and talk to more than a hundred accountants who support small businesses and<s> <\/s>as we were researching how to make this product work, and one of the things we came away with really clearly understanding was that <s>&nbsp;<\/s>it&#8217;s not enough to just give the small business a forecast or data. There are a lot of forecasting tools in the market. There&#8217;s a lot of FP and a tools,there&#8217;s a lot of things that help the customer see their data. But that was that should be the starting point for the small business where you understand their current cash situation and data or financial needs. And you don&#8217;t just dump a forecast on them and say, okay, here&#8217;s your data, go figure out what you need to do. They need help. Like the community banker would do in the past. Understanding what the right things to do are. And so what we&#8217;re working on building out now in SteadiPay,<s> <\/s>we&#8217;ve put together the front end of that and now we&#8217;re working on the backend, which is identifying what buttons the small business can push, what levers they can pull financially to improve their cash situation and point them toward the right solutions to do that. And maybe we&#8217;ll build those solutions in house<s> <\/s>with you guys, like we have with our treasury management tools. And maybe we&#8217;ll partner with some of those<s> <\/s>in places where there&#8217;s great solutions already in market, but we want to have a portion of that role of having deep insight into the business. Ours is based on data rather than an in-person relationship,&nbsp; but using that deep understanding to help you find the access to the right tools for your business.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michael Callas&nbsp; <\/strong>[00:30:21] I love it. Love it. So Anthony, thanks so much <s>&nbsp;<\/s>for that and spending some time with Helene<s> <\/s>and me in our<s> <\/s>&nbsp;\u201cborn in the USA\u201d version of banking on air. <s>&nbsp;<\/s>Anthony,<s> <\/s>wondering if you have any advice for a FinTech founder starting today, 2021 in the US.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anthony Strike <\/strong>[00:30:37] Oh, geez. I still very much feel like I know only the most superficial amount of stuff about the FinTech world and <s>&nbsp;<\/s>frankly, nobody should be really taking advice from me on how to start a FinTech company yet. But, but if I did have to give some advice, I would say <s>I<\/s> don&#8217;t feel like you&#8217;re stuck using the same tools and infrastructure that the companies who built themselves up over the last few years used <s>&nbsp;<\/s>Doing that&nbsp; will leave you undifferentiated. Take some <s>&nbsp;<\/s>not financial risk with your customer&#8217;s money, but take some risk around your product architecture and try some new things that are coming onto the market. There&#8217;s some awesome stuff. There&#8217;s a bunch of companies in the Phoenix and Unit and bond are all doing cool new things. Move is obviously, we&#8217;re big believers in Move. There&#8217;s a lot of people to handle heavy lifts on other things like<s> <\/s>regulatory<s> <\/s>requirements and PCI compliance and KYC and KYB . <s>&nbsp;<\/s>So don&#8217;t look to pass success stories to help you figure out how to structure your product. Do the research to understand what&#8217;s new in the market, cause that&#8217;s where I think you&#8217;ll be able to differentiate.&nbsp; And the other thing I&#8217;d say is<s> <\/s>don&#8217;t start a PFM&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michael Callas&nbsp; <\/strong>[00:31:41] For the love of all that is Holy, do not start a PFM. A hundred percent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino <\/strong>[00:31:45] That&#8217;s very good advice. So people make sure you take that on board. It&#8217;s been excellent advice throughout the whole of this conversation. I&#8217;ve thoroughly enjoyed having both of my guests on tonight as we&#8217;ve taken on journey around the U S and we&#8217;ve come back over to Europe and we&#8217;ve taken our experience back over, and we&#8217;ve all agreed that SMB stroke SMEs are vital to financial services and we need to serve them better because they are going to help us come out of our current situation and turn the corner.

best way to now effectively offer digital services to the US SMB market to deliver the banking tools to really help them grow their businesses? Being underbanked is something we\u2019d more readily associate with developing nations rather than the US, yet underbanking is prevalent in the United States too. In the US, most small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) do indeed have access to a basic bank account, they can deposit and withdraw cash, but on many levels this market segment still remains \u2018underbanked\u2019 as sophisticated service provision by digital providers has focused on acquiring either very large corporations as customers or mass-market retail. In our Banking on Air podcast we look at how to extend that high personal touch to digital banking to serve a wider network of SMBs and really offer them the support and tools they need to succeed.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In this episode of \u2018Banking on Air\u2019, host <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/helene-panzarino\/\">Helene Panzarino<\/a> is joined by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/mcallas\/\">Michael Callas<\/a>, Chief Strategy Officer of Vacuumlabs, and our guest <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/anthony-strike-3316089\/\">Anthony Strike<\/a>, CEO of US-based <a href=\"https:\/\/steadipay.com\/\">SteadiPay<\/a>.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>SteadiPay is focused on small and medium-sized businesses and helps them track, forecast and manage cash flow whilst earning the best interest rates on their cash holdings through a bank-agnostic sweep account. SteadiPay initially launched as an app to help individual customers manage credit card spending but developed its offering to fill the gap in the market for the underserved SMB segment. In our show, Anthony talks us through how he grew and developed his business and how SteadiPay honed in on the sweet spot for this market without falling into the trap of becoming too niche.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Anthony realized that many small business owners were struggling with the complexities of their cash flow management. Undertaking more than 300 customer interviews and speaking to over 100 small business accountants to best ascertain needs, Anthony saw the significant potential. It was then that Anthony hit a few roadblocks as he realized that many of the tech companies he was looking to help actually build his new product didn\u2019t in fact have the capability to do so or the ability to build any kind of differentiated offering.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>SteadiPay knew it could rely on Vacuumlabs and has partnered with us to build the key technical elements it wanted. SteadiPay now offers a cash dashboard for SMBs to track and forecast cash, a \u2018cash optimiser\u2019, a bank-agnostic sweep account to secure better money market rates for customers\u2019 cash holdings.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The company is now building out its offering to bring SMBs the very best in financial tools to underpin their growth. This is something that draws on some of the best from the past, recapturing the personal banking relationship\u2014as through the service offered by old-school community banks who understood all the intricacies of each customer\u2019s business. And it\u2019s powered by some of the best of the future with deep data insights pointing customers towards the best solutions to improve their cash situation.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Learn more from our podcast about what SteadiPay will be bringing in to support the banking needs of small and medium-sized businesses, freeing these entrepreneurs up to focus on what they themselves do best.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Find out more about Anthony via <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/anthony-strike-3316089\/\">his LinkedIn profile.<\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u2018Banking on Air\u2019 is the official Vacuumlabs podcast covering the challenges, opportunities, perspectives and opinions that matter to you and to our community. In this podcast, we are looking under the hood of the changing face of tech: the acceleration in all things digital, the impact of regulation (and disruption), the need for genuine collaboration \u2013 and the specter of competitors old and new as it plays out in fintech and financial services around the world.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This podcast is brought to you by Vacuumlabs \u2013 and we\u2019re sharing our experience and expertise in creating solutions for the digital journey for professionals, community banks, and fintechs.\u00a0 We believe that the future is in communities when it comes to digital transformation in financial services, and we invite you to join us and our guests over the coming weeks and months.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>And don&#8217;t forget to subscribe!<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"post__player player\"><iframe border=\"0\" class=\"player__iframe\" src=\"https:\/\/anchor.fm\/insidethevacuum\/embed\/episodes\/25-SMB-acceleration-in-the-US-with-Anthony-Strike-SteadiPay-eq5ea6\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" scrolling=\"no\" frameBorder=\"0\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n\r\n\r\n\t\n\t<div id=\"podcast-subscribe-button-3988\" class=\"secondline-psb-radius-style\">\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n<div class=\"secondline-psb-subscribe-icons\" style=\"margin-top:-2em;margin-bottom:1em;\"><strong>WHERE TO LISTEN<\/strong> &nbsp;

might that actually hamper your progress? Having access to the resources of a major institution may seem like a gift but the reality is a bit more complex. For a number of years, Jeremy Takle worked at Barclays and led the building banks in Scandinavia, South East Asia, and the US. More recently, he stepped away from Barclays to co-found his own digital bank, Pennyworth. So what can he share from his experiences of both building banks within large organizations, and outside of them?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cI was lucky enough that Barclays was global and the skillsets and knowledge around building banks, distribution channels, and new platforms were all there inside the organization. You could pick that up. So I got a career where I learned how to plant new flags in new markets and build retail &amp; commercial banking businesses across the world.\u201d &#8211; Jeremy Takle<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>However, being part of Barclays did not only bring advantages such as banking licenses and distribution channels, it also came with some major drawbacks according to Jeremy:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cThe challenge then of course was to convince: First, internally within the organization, to take what had been a credit card monoline and turn it into a consumer banking business. Hence getting buy-in from the Group Executive. You still had the same challenges that come with having a big parent with siloed structures. You would have to actually walk around and convince every single function to bring themselves to bear on this problem, even though you had a Group Executive mandate. Can we have the technology partners and engineers that we need to develop this? Can we have the credit risk mandates and staff to help us do this? Can we have the marketing and brand permissions to build this?\u201d &#8211; Jeremy Takle<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Going through this same process over and over again with every bank launch sparked Jeremy&#8217;s mission to create a new digital bank. He\u2019s now the co-founder of a new independent start-up, Pennyworth, which believes it can offer better terms to its clients. And, this time the team wanted to shake off all the shackles that come with being tied to a financial megalith. Pennyworth\u2019s aims and target market have been clearly defined from the outset. The bank will focus on UK \u2018aspiring affluent\u2019 customers with annual incomes in excess of \u00a340k or liquid assets of over \u00a340k. Jeremy explains why Pennyworth focuses on this specific demographic:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cMost people we spoke to felt that they weren\u2019t getting the most out of their money. And they weren&#8217;t sure what to change to make. And particularly the personalization element they were getting from the existing bank simply wasn&#8217;t there. And so there&#8217;s inherent demand. So what we wanted to do was provide a solution \u2013 where we&#8217;d help people focus on the goals they&#8217;re trying to achieve. Buying things&#8230; or preparing to! Buying a car, or saving up for a big event like a wedding, or to buy a property or retire.\u201d &#8211; Jeremy Takle<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Jeremy believes that in terms of getting the right business model, the key to success isn\u2019t trying to fight a battle that is very hard to win:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cIt&#8217;s about not trying to win that battle for the current account. With such low switching numbers, what you end up with is a large number of customers not moving their salary mandate, not moving their actual banking, but actually just using it as a prepaid card, a payment vehicle. Therefore you end up with a lot of low-value customers. But for loans, time deposits, instant savings, we can actually price at very attractive rates for the customer: A product that actually once we book it is profitable on a unitary basis because we&#8217;re taking a spread between our savings and loans. It&#8217;s a much smaller spread than you would get if you were a traditional big bank.\u201d &#8211; Jeremy Takle<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>To find out more about establishing banks within big corporations versus outside of them, listen to our new Banking on Air podcast episode featuring Jeremy Takle od Pennyworth \u2013 Available on<a href=\"https:\/\/podcasts.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/inside-the-vacuum\/id1505101625?ign-mpt=uo%3D4\">&nbsp;<strong>Apple Podcasts<\/strong><\/a>,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.breaker.audio\/inside-the-vacuum\">&nbsp;<strong>Breaker<\/strong><\/a>,<a href=\"https:\/\/podcasts.google.com\/?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy8xODhkNTE2OC9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw%3D%3D\">&nbsp;<strong>Google Podcasts<\/strong><\/a>,<a href=\"https:\/\/overcast.fm\/itunes1505101625\/inside-the-vacuum\">&nbsp;<strong>Overcast<\/strong><\/a>,<a href=\"https:\/\/pca.st\/jdvlp9mq\">&nbsp;<strong>Pocket Casts<\/strong><\/a>,<a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/show\/2wKh1nEPsvZfJc8nZFBFah\">&nbsp;<strong>Spotify<\/strong><\/a>&nbsp;or here:<\/p>\n\n\n<p><div class=\"post__player player\"><iframe border=\"0\" class=\"player__iframe\" src=\"https:\/\/anchor.fm\/insidethevacuum\/embed\/episodes\/24-Launching-a-new-bank-with-Jeremy-Takle-Pennyworth-eortrv\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" scrolling=\"no\" frameBorder=\"0\"><\/iframe><\/div><br \/>\n\t\n\t<div id=\"podcast-subscribe-button-3988\" class=\"secondline-psb-radius-style\">\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n<div class=\"secondline-psb-subscribe-icons\" style=\"margin-top:-2em;margin-bottom:1em;\"><strong>WHERE TO LISTEN<\/strong> &nbsp;

But not for everyone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>More and more consumers choose a form of paying later or paying in installments. These delayed payment options, also known as <strong>&#8216;Buy Now, Pay Later&#8217; (BNPL)<\/strong>, offer a low or 0% interest rate of micro-credit at checkout, and the market is booming.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The BNPL market has expanded rapidly in 2020 as more people went shopping online. BNPL providers have also seen a massive increase in valuations and money raised this year. The cumulative market capitalization of BNPL companies is now totaling more than <strong>USD 2 billion<\/strong>, and BNPL transactions increased by 200%. Forecasts are overwhelmingly positive, and they expect further growth in the coming 3-5 years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this blog post, we will explore 3 reasons why it makes sense to offer consumer credit as a service, followed by examples of companies building their own BNPL solution or integrating with one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>3 reasons why you should consider offering BNPL options<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>1. It&#8217;s not a trend, but the future of payment&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Consumer credit has traditionally been the domain of credit card providers and banks. But that is changing: both credit card debt and adoption are in decline. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/andriacheng\/2020\/12\/16\/why-retailers-are-embracing-buy-now-pay-later-service-this-holiday-season\/#:~:text=Its%20study%20found%20that%2042,have%20used%20a%20BNPL%20service.\">Forbes<\/a> highlighted that Gen Z and Millennials (ages 16-40) and higher educated individuals are more likely to choose BNPL to finance their shopping online.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pymnts.com\/buy-now-pay-later\/2020\/workwear-affordable-essential-workers-frontline-bnpl\/\">PYMNTS<\/a> found that <strong>87% of consumers between the ages of 22 and 44 have expressed interest in BNPL<\/strong>. Afterall, why pay credit card fees and go through a credit rating process if you can pay in installments at 0% interest?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cBNPL provides greater flexibility of payment terms as opposed to the traditional credit card model where interest-free periods are fixed,\u201d said Jerome Gudgeon, Group Chief Technology Officer at Global Processing Services (GPS), the trusted and proven go-to payments processing partner for today\u2019s leading challenger brands, including Revolut, Starling Bank and BNPL fintech Zilch. \u201cBNPL secures revenue via merchants who are charged a commission at the point of sale and is therefore a different lending alternative.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>2<\/strong>. <strong>It&#8217;s a competitive differentiator<\/strong> <strong>in 2021<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In mature markets like banking, e-commerce as well as some tech verticals, competition is fierce. Offering the extra service of one-click delayed payments at no additional cost may be a point of differentiation that prompts consumers to switch whom they buy from.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The business value of the service is straightforward. In a survey by PYMTS, <strong>43% of consumers that used a BNPL app say that they won&#8217;t go back to shopping at stores that don&#8217;t offer it<\/strong>. For some categories, BNPL options have already become the industry norm: think of high-ticket investments in essential items (e.g., laptop or phone) or fashion items that you wish to try on at home but may still want to return.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2021, a lot of young starters are living from paycheck to paycheck. Banks can help them by splitting payments into installments. In some cases, this might incentivize people to consume more than they can afford, but for most people, it is a simple way to spread their cash flow without any extra hidden fees.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>3. To businesses, risks are low<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What many don&#8217;t realize is that e-commerce websites face no risk when integrating with a BNPL provider. The shops receive the full payment amount right away and pay a commission fee to the BNPL provider.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BNPL companies Klarna and Afterpay claim that for e-commerce websites<strong> conversion rates increased on average by 44% and 22%<\/strong>, respectively. Another potential advantage is an increase in Average Order Value (AOV) or basket size. Afterpay reports a 40% increase in AOV for websites that integrate with them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the biggest BNPL providers, Klarna, saw a large increase in credit default rates in the tumultuous year of 2020. But even then, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.nl\/klarna-fintech-giant-reports-sevenfold-increase-in-losses-2020-8\/\">Business Insider<\/a> reported that the losses on bad creditors accounted for only 0.6% of the USD 24.9 billion in total sales.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you end up building your own solution, there are many semi-automated solutions available that reduce risks and prevent high default rates. These building blocks range from digital ID checks to AI-driven qualifications and more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Integrating vs. building a BNPL solution yourself<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The next step to consider is whether you want to build a pay later solution yourself or integrate with one. Many companies in the payments and finance sector are partnering on all sides, and the market is very much alive. The largest players, banks, and more exclusive e-commerce websites are starting to build their in-house credit solutions to differentiate themselves from the competition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Building yourself doesn&#8217;t mean you have to make everything from scratch.<\/strong> The payment infrastructure is often already there, and for difficult problems, integrations are available with existing solutions like AI-driven credit decisioning and automated authentication.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some examples of how companies integrate or build BNPL solutions per industry:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Retail Banks<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Banks are mostly creating their own innovative credit solutions. For instance, Chase Bank offers cardholders the possibility to split recent large transactions over monthly intervals afterward.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Citibank created <a href=\"https:\/\/www.creditcardinsider.com\/blog\/citi-flex-plan-the-ins-and-outs-of-citis-financing-options\/\">Citi Flex Pay<\/a> to offer to pay in installments on purchases over $100 through their payment gateway. In Australia, where BNPL already sees high adaptation, traditional banks choose to partner directly with big BNPL providers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Online banks\/payment wallets<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Online banks (neobanks) have been challenging traditional banks with innovative online banking apps and cheap debit and credit cards. With the rise of many newcomers in the past years, the sector has become increasingly competitive, and the need for differentiation has increased.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new online bank <a href=\"https:\/\/www.varomoney.com\/cash-advance\/\">Varobank<\/a> offers an innovative way to get $100 instantly on your account. Alternatively, users can request a 3-day early payment of their usual salary &#8211; both at 0% interest rates. <a href=\"https:\/\/twistopay.com\/\">Twisto<\/a>, an all-in-one payment app like PayPal, allows users to send and receive money and has some innovative BNPL options. Users can choose to pay in installments on the spot at some merchant partner websites or split a purchase afterward with the app.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Payment Service Providers<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Most Buy Now Pay Later options work seamlessly with typical Payment Service Providers (PSPs) like Mollie, Stripe, and Adyen. Some BNPL providers use the existing Mastercard or VISA infrastructure, and so can be used anywhere.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though compatibility is there, most PSPs choose to partner with dedicated BNPL providers because there is the win-win of higher adoption due to the benefits of a seamless payment flow and integrated onboarding processes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stripe has announced it would partner with Splitit to make onboarding easier for new Splitit users. Adyen meanwhile plans to incorporate Affirm&#8217;s BNPL installment plan technology in its payments platform (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pymnts.com\/news\/payment-methods\/2020\/adyen-adds-installment-options-to-payments-platform-in-deal-with-affirm\/\">Pymts<\/a>).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>E-commerce<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Most e-commerce B2C companies, especially in fashion and lifestyle, choose to integrate with existing BNPL options. According to research done by both Afterpay and Klarna, conversion rates and additional traffic go up when people open their app for a good deal.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For e-commerce shops that offer higher-priced products, traditional payment in installments with interest fees is a good option. A wide range of white-label solutions and plugins exist for this, ready to be implemented. While this market races towards a new industry norm of zero interest fees, much change, and further innovation are expected.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>More prominent e-commerce companies or e-commerce website builders are looking into building their solutions. Amazon, for example, is doing this with its Monthly Payments feature. Shopify is partnering exclusively with Affirm to power its own Shop Pay Installments (<a href=\"https:\/\/wwd.com\/business-news\/technology\/shopify-affirm-installment-payments-1203684816\/\">WWD<\/a>), eBay is partnering with Afterpay and Paypal (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pymnts.com\/visa\/2020\/visa-unveils-fintech-partnership-program-in-europe\/\">PYMNTS<\/a>), and website-builder software Wix is partnering with Sezzle as it&#8217;s the BNPL platform of choice (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/sezzle-partners-with-wix-to-bring-buy-now-pay-later-to-millions-of-businesses-and-online-stores-301175542.html\">PRNewsWire<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The BNPL market is growing and advancing rapidly.

Paying for supermarket groceries with your card or mobile phone is very convenient. Yet, the approval process behind digital payments is rather complex. Joanne Dewar of Global Processing Services (GPS), a pioneer in paytech and the developer of GPS Apex, a global issuer processing platform, says GPS was in the right place at the right time&nbsp; when they developed their flexible platform. This has helped the company secure big name customers such as $5.5bn neobank Revolut, digital card issuer Curve, and UK digital bank Monzo. The GPS platform is also accredited by Mastercard and Visa.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cWe were fully tokenized from the outset, which meant that new fintech startups didn&#8217;t need to worry about their PCI certification. We were really the only processor that had the functionality that they were looking for and whether they were going into debit or prepaid, all of those features and functionality enables real-time alerts on your mobile phone. We were able to get to a place where we could say that transactions \u2018just happened\u2019. The platform needs to be up all the time in order to achieve that.\u201d &#8211; Joanne Dewar, GPS<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Strong relationships are key<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A flexible platform was just one piece of the puzzle. Another piece centres around strong and enduring relationships. Right from the outset, GPS was able to go on the journey with customers, knowing that their day one starting point is a rather different place from where they\u2019ll be in three years\u2019 time. Today, the company provides the backbone service for fintech, digital banks, and e-wallets and its global issuer processing platform is now used by more than 180+ customers in 60 countries worldwide.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Initial hard graft has paid off and GPS has developed a well-earned reputation for trustworthiness and has secured many high-profile loyal customers. Sticking close to many of the digital banking heavyweights and garnering as much experience as possible, GPS is now a poster child for best practice, as Joanne Dewar recounts:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cMark Bailey was branching out and wanted to be able to create a challenger bank from within the megalith that is RBS, and in that relationship he said: \u201cTreat me like a traditional bank. Talk to me as you would to any other fintech. GPS is the one that has launched 250 programmes. We want to learn from you in terms of what typically goes wrong. Where are the learning points? What are the things you have to get right before you go live?\u201d We were able to share our experience.\u201d &#8211; Joanne Dewar, GPS<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>GPS helps their customers navigate a highly complex market, and Joanne Dewar believes GPS is well-equipped with the knowledge and experience to help guide them through this maze:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cAnd again, that&#8217;s where the partnership comes in. We&#8217;re able to help people navigate that complexity because we&#8217;ve been there, done it. We&#8217;ve had a taste of&nbsp; lots of different flavours. We&#8217;ve seen what works, we\u2019ve seen what doesn&#8217;t. Our customers have an idea, they&#8217;ve got a solution. They want to get to market and we can help them figure out the things that they need to do in order to get that solution in play.\u201d &#8211; Joanne Dewar, GPS<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Financial inclusion and a cashless society<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what does the future hold? According to Joanne, we are going to see an acceleration towards becoming a cashless society. During the COVID-19 pandemic, merchants and their customers showed a strong preference for cashless payments and that trend is going to continue growing. But Joanne says there are still obstacles to surmount, particularly in terms of broadening financial inclusion:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cWith the acceleration in the use of digital payments and the move away from cash, the financial inclusion agenda is a hundred times more important because there are still way too many people that are a hundred percent reliant on cash. And I think from a financial inclusion perspective, the moment is around how the government engages with&nbsp; digital payments and what that leads to in terms of adoption. The key is you can&#8217;t let one side of things accelerate beyond the other, moving towards a cashless economy society means striking the right balance and making sure no one gets left behind.&#8221;

We\u2019re happy using internet banking to pay our bills or request a loan. Likewise, apps to check our account balance, withdraw cash from the ATM or to order a new credit card. But what\u2019s the real purpose behind digital banking? According to Colin Payne, VP of Capgemini Invent, for this we need to drill down to underlying customer motivations and seek out their core priorities:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cBanking is not a subject area, which fills people with inspired thinking and makes them want to switch on their phone and access their bank account immediately. People want banking that\u2019s transparent and simple. They want it to be really invisible, because honestly, who of us really want to engage with banking products? Getting a mortgage is not about mortgage products but about buying a home. It\u2019s a major life experience.\u201d &#8211; Colin Payne<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This is something Colin calls \u2018<strong>inventive banking<\/strong>\u2019 \u2013 being there for the customer with the right product at the right time, harnessing technology to deliver seamless, painless services. And, to move towards inventive banking, banks need to use data. To truly engage with clients and make a difference, a bank needs to know its customer base and tap into the granularity of customer data to understand their habits and priorities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cThe right trajectory for banks is to serve individual customer needs. We have to know who they are and then we can start talking to them about what they need. And once you\u2019ve identified the need, just serve it.\u201d &#8211; Colin Payne<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The key is to strengthen relationships:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cTo serve your tribe or community through using data, you can surprise the person on the upside through providing just what they had in mind. If you can have a relationship with someone who identifies in a certain way and you can likewise subtly channel that sense of community and bring that on board, you can have a conversation which engages in a much more direct, understandable way. This is <strong>humanizing banking<\/strong>.\u201d &#8211; Colin Payne<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>To find out more about inventive and humanizing banking and how to best harness customer data, listen to our new Banking on Air podcast episode featuring Colin Payne of Capgemini Invent \u2013 Available on<a href=\"https:\/\/podcasts.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/inside-the-vacuum\/id1505101625?ign-mpt=uo%3D4\"> <strong>Apple Podcasts<\/strong><\/a>,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.breaker.audio\/inside-the-vacuum\"> <strong>Breaker<\/strong><\/a>,<a href=\"https:\/\/podcasts.google.com\/?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy8xODhkNTE2OC9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw%3D%3D\"> <strong>Google Podcasts<\/strong><\/a>,<a href=\"https:\/\/overcast.fm\/itunes1505101625\/inside-the-vacuum\"> <strong>Overcast<\/strong><\/a>,<a href=\"https:\/\/pca.st\/jdvlp9mq\"> <strong>Pocket Casts<\/strong><\/a>,<a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/show\/2wKh1nEPsvZfJc8nZFBFah\"> <strong>Spotify<\/strong><\/a> or here:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"post__player player\"><iframe border=\"0\" class=\"player__iframe\" src=\"https:\/\/anchor.fm\/insidethevacuum\/embed\/episodes\/22-Value-of-data-with-Colin-Payne-Capgemini-enh3gf\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" scrolling=\"no\" frameBorder=\"0\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Here\u2019s a rundown of this episode:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>0:45 Colin&#8217;s professional journey<\/li><li>03:00 Potential of digital banking<\/li><li>07:15 Changes happening in banks and inventive banking<\/li><li>15:00 Importance of data<\/li><li>21:00 Community banking<\/li><li>32:00 Covid challenges<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Links from the episode:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/colin-payne\/\">Colin Payne on LinkedIn<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.capgemini.com\/service\/invent\/\">Capgemini Invent website<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/capgemini-invent\/\">Capgemini Invent LinkedIn<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8212;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Colin is an accomplished Vice President, with over 25 years of experience designing and delivering digital solutions that transform customer experience and deliver successful outcomes for clients.

Internal drivers often center around cost efficiencies, with digitalization seen as a means to strip out unnecessary overheads. Fear of being overtaken by big tech is a major push too as banks seek to embrace digitalization as an engine for core growth.<br><br>However, according to Martin McCann, CEO and Co-Founder of Trade Ledger, some 95% of banks\u2019 attempts to achieve this fail and financial institutions struggle significantly to trim processing times for day-to-day operations, and this could well end up costing them both customers and earnings. What\u2019s blocking their progress?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key issue, Martin says, is that they are seeking to tackle this transformation from the wrong direction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cThey always start with the assumption that this is a process re-engineering exercise, and it&#8217;s not. They&#8217;re trying to take existing business processes and technology workloads and move these to the cloud. And it&#8217;s all about cost-cutting and efficiency at a massive scale. But this fails. All they end up with is a slightly more efficient version of the same business. Ultimately, what they need to be doing is creating a complete re-imagining: considering what the digital data that exists today in the ecosystem where you operate will enable in terms of new ways of thinking about convenient, frictionless value-add for your customers.\u201d &#8211; Martin McCann<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cFinance is the world\u2019s most heavily-regulated industry and the regulatory burden has now become so great that it\u2019s negatively impacting the industry.\u201d &#8211; Martin McCann<br><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Outdated risk models create significant problems too:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cIf you look at the risk models in business banking, most of them date back 20 or 30 years. So most of the banks that we look at are still using the same risk models today that were developed in the nineties.\u201d &#8211; Martin McCann<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over-reliance on consulting companies isn\u2019t always helpful either.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cBanks tend to outsource the problem to the consultants and ask them for a solution. Using skilled, external consultants in order to plug your skills gap is a great idea. Asking a consulting firm to come in and take care of your future strategy and deliver it is much more problematic.\u201d &#8211; Martin McCann<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>So how do we build a successful digitalization strategy? There\u2019s certainly plenty of need for swifter, more customer-friendly solutions. To achieve these, banks and fintechs should be working closely together to deliver successful automated, digitalized platforms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/tradeledger.io\/solutions-business-finance\/\">Trade Ledger is a company specializing in lendtech<\/a> that\u2019s created a new digital lending technology platform for the banking sector. Previously, the loan approval process by banks would take several weeks and involve a great deal of documentation and a slew of staff hours. However, Trade Ledger has automated and revolutionized this process. It\u2019s now possible to slash the time required for the loan approval process from a lengthy six weeks&#8230; to just four minutes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cThat&#8217;s everything from initial contact point to application, through to onboarding, the credit assessment, decisioning, documentation creation, <strong>product fulfillment<\/strong>, through to drawdowns, servicing and management of the product and reconciliation and <strong>closing<\/strong>. Typically, prior to Trade Ledger, a bank would need between six and eight systems to do that.&#8221; &#8211; Martin McCann<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>To find out more about digital transformation in banking and how Trade Ledger\u2019s lending platform is helping plug the huge global credit gap for SMEs, listen to our new Banking on Air podcast episode with Martin McCann \u2013 Available on<a href=\"https:\/\/podcasts.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/inside-the-vacuum\/id1505101625?ign-mpt=uo%3D4\"> <strong>Apple Podcasts<\/strong><\/a>,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.breaker.audio\/inside-the-vacuum\"> <strong>Breaker<\/strong><\/a>,<a href=\"https:\/\/podcasts.google.com\/?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy8xODhkNTE2OC9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw%3D%3D\"> <strong>Google Podcasts<\/strong><\/a>,<a href=\"https:\/\/overcast.fm\/itunes1505101625\/inside-the-vacuum\"> <strong>Overcast<\/strong><\/a>,<a href=\"https:\/\/pca.st\/jdvlp9mq\"> <strong>Pocket Casts<\/strong><\/a>,<a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/show\/2wKh1nEPsvZfJc8nZFBFah\"> <strong>Spotify<\/strong><\/a> or here:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is a rundown of episode:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>00:39 Introduction into lending, its&#8217; future, and Trade Ledger<\/li><li>07:10 Why digital transformation in banks doesn&#8217;t work<\/li><li>17:36 How Trade Ledger pioneered the industry<\/li><li>23:30 Cooperation with Vacuumlabs<\/li><li>28:20 Future of Trade Ledger &amp; banking<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Links from the episode:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/mccannmartin\/\">Martin McCann on LinkedIn<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.tradeledger.io\">Trade Ledger web<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/trade-ledger\/\">Trade Ledger LinkedIn<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8212;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/mccannmartin\/\">Martin McCann<\/a> is CEO and Co-Founder of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tradeledger.io\">Trade Ledger<\/a>, the world\u2019s first open digital banking platform that gives banks the ability to assess business lending risk in real-time.

You may be surprised to find out what a significant and growing global force this now, is and how fintech organizations can benefit.<br><br>In the Islamic world, institutions operate in accordance with the guiding principles of Islam \u2013 both what the religion allows: <em>halal,<\/em> and what it prohibits: <em>haram.<\/em> \u2013 Banking is certainly no exception.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Islamic finance follows the principles of<strong> Sharia law<\/strong>. This means in practice that interest payments are not a feature of the banking system, as Islamic law forbids Muslim people to either receive or pay interest. Likewise, certain sectors are strictly avoided for investment such as tobacco, alcohol or gambling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>So how do Islamic banks provide help for home buyers? <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A very popular type of Islamic \u2018mortgage\u2019 is Ijarah or \u2018lease to own\u2019. The bank purchases the property outright and the person who wants to eventually secure full ownership of the property pays both regular \u2018rent\u2019 to the bank for use of the property and also repays the purchase price in installments. Once the principal has been repaid in full, ownership is transferred.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Syed Musheer Ahmed, Founder &amp; MD of Finstep Asia explained, <\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cOwnership of the asset is transferred to the holder, and the asset is leased back to the insurer; the person is charged rent to use of that asset during the time period of the bond.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Likewise, other financial systems have bonds which are, of course, interest-bearing instruments; yet \u2018interest\u2019 can never feature in a Sharia-compliant financial product. Instead, a sukuk is popularly used to generate regular income streams for investors. This is an Islamic financial certificate with some similarity to a bond. Through a sukuk investors hold a direct share in a specific tangible asset, and on the back of this are entitled to a share of the earnings that asset generates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Specific services for specific community<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>These are clearly very different financial products to those seen from other types of banks. One exciting aspect is that even though these Sharia-compliant instruments have been especially developed for Muslims, they are by no means the only ones who could benefit here:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p> \u201cThese products clearly grew out of a religious context, but they could definitely be of strong interest to those of other faiths too.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Another key factor is that close to two billion Muslims now live all across the world and it is imperative to provide them with financial services in accordance with Islam. This presents a significant market opportunity for fintechs everywhere. According to Musheer, there\u2019s a vast and ever widening education gap to be plugged and huge global opportunities for taking Islamic banking digital.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cSenior management in banking needs to think about how to deliver new business services because it\u2019s now a matter of survival. If these banks aren\u2019t able to update their processes and their digital offerings are not sufficiently compelling, they will face existential threats. It\u2019s up to key consultants like Vacuumlabs to tell them about the major opportunities they are potentially missing out on. Digital transformation is key. There is a huge need for outreach in the form of education.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>So how does Islamic finance actually work in practice? Some aspects may come as a surprise but features of Islamic finance could potentially be of benefit to you too.

That\u2019s also the story of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.betenth.com\/\">Boulevard<\/a>, the first bank for black Americans in the US, established by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/donald-j-hawkins\/\">Donald Hawkins<\/a>. With he himself being a part of this community, he could see huge gaps in how people from this community were treated and educated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cBlack America has systematically been removed from really learning money, and how it works. It\u2019s kinda tough to be free in a country, when the people who hold the power strings have been your oppressors as well.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Donald wanted to help those people affected by this situation, so he established a new neobank, Boulevard, which focuses on teaching how to truly own the wealth\u2013building process for individual needs. However, as he highlights, Boulevard doesn\u2019t exclude anyone; but on the other hand, it is not possible to create one neobank for all minorities, because there are too many and unique needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cWe hope there are going to be companies that continue to spring up and address those specific needs for their affinity groups as well.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In the modern world for every bank, whether it\u2019s neobank or one that\u2019s been going for 50 years, it is crucial to reach out to their customers, especially generation Z. With the COVID pandemic, everything is moving virtual and banks need to keep up to pace. For banks, it is not that easy anymore to establish a loyal partnership with their clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cThe relationships are still going to be key. Banks have the luxury of being a first mover because they have that density, that connectivity. But how do you transfer that relationship from the physical face-to-face interaction to something more digitized?\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Another important thing for banks is the acquisition of customers.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cYou gotta have something that customers can compare to in a favorable way. A problem that I\u2019ve seen in the world of banking and finance overall, is that a lot of banks really feel as if relations is their superpower. But they don\u2019t realize that every bank feels that relations are <em>their <\/em>superpower\u2026 when the truth of it is that the majority of them are more transactional.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Features are no longer deal-breakers because the competition is catching up very quickly. This means that all banks need to adopt new things early to be competitive. If you are late to the game, you can be quickly swallowed up by another bank. Customers have a full pool of banks to choose from, and falling asleep at the wheel can be fatal for banks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>So what is the future?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cTraditional banks have a lot of experience at taking care of customers and members. And I think that\u2019s what we can learn as neobanks and fintechs from them. But that\u2019s why working together can be such a plus. You take the experience from the traditional banks and you marry that with innovation and modern tools and features from fintech.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Would you like to hear more about neobanks, relationships and future of banking?

And on the face of it \u2013 with big corporations frequently making the headlines with stories of environmental damage and tax avoidance \u2013 it might at face value appear to be true.<br><br>But only at face value. The fact is, organizations of every size and shape in every industry sector are under immense pressure to ensure that their operations are ecologically sound, and the fintech sector is no exception.<br><br>In fact, it\u2019s in fintech where some of the most truly innovative advances are being made. Here are 6 examples.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Goodbye to the plastic<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The words \u2018credit cards\u2019 and \u2018plastic\u2019 have been synonymous for decades; but perhaps not for much longer. Spanish bank <a href=\"https:\/\/www.caixabank.com\/comunicacion\/noticia\/caixabank-launches-first-biodegradable-cards_en.html?id=41854\">CaixaBank recently launched one of the world\u2019s first biodegradable payment cards<\/a>. Instead of using regular plastic, which is hard to recycle, Caixabank opted for a new material, made up of corn starch and biomass, and it cuts the carbon footprint caused by manufacturing cards in half.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building on that, Caixabank are also offering customers the ability to recycle their plastic cards in its branches. With over 17 million cards in Spain alone, the bank holds nearly 25% of the total market share; this has essentially changed a quarter of the market overnight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tap to plant<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many businesses are investing in tree planting initiatives as part of their carbon programs. Amsterdam-based challenger bank Bunq is extending the participation to its customers with its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eu-startups.com\/2020\/01\/amsterdam-based-challenger-bank-bunq-plants-40000-trees-via-its-green-card\/\">pay to plant a tree program<\/a>. \u201cSince the successful launch of the bunq Green Card, a metal card that plants a tree for every \u20ac100 spent, bunq users have offset a global reduction of CO2 emissions by 12.3 million kg, which translates into over 13,000 flights from Paris to New York.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Making this initiative part of people\u2019s daily lives has been the key to its success, and it\u2019s captured the hearts of its customers \u2013 when the company created a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/11\/28\/bunq-launches-metal-card-and-plants-a-tree-for-every-e100-spent\/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAC1gI5s8F0D7pntA2APDnPsF59mYyOHg-aaUhSxlCg6aNuF4hcvIEC-P7XAbCTfKc-_nwCoDXaOzVls-4GY_V859dh2xlSblflYge3RUqAhQ1zvmc34_M7NRxTahJ8v-Wp7nAPMcB1wcAiGkJbm6nAbQuU-iw43dMVwfXmHVRGS3\">limited \u201cFounders Edition\u201d card<\/a>, it sold out almost immediately.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>From trees to the rainforest<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking the idea to the next level, Treecard\u2019s focus is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.treecard.org\/\">exactly as the name suggests<\/a> \u2013 80% of its profits go towards reforestation, with no greenwashing. With each card actually made from wood \u2013 and 300,000 cards being made from each tree \u2013 demand is high, resulting in a referral program that helps bump applicants up the queue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cEach card features a unique wood grain and is made from sustainably sourced FSC cherry wood. And when you pay using TreeCard\u2122, the store pays us a small transaction fee which we use to fund reforestation projects.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A dip in the chips<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Plastic isn\u2019t the only ecologically unsound element of payment cards. Production of the semiconductor chips used in the majority of cards is hugely polluting \u2013 a typical semiconductor factory will use 20 million gallons of water a month which, along with a long list of toxic chemicals, has to be disposed of as waste.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Paris-based technology company Idemia saw the simple \u2013 and obvious \u2013 solution: develop smaller payment chips, as well as more eco-friendly cards.<br><br>\u201cThe company started with the chip design. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fintechfutures.com\/2020\/10\/french-firm-idemia-launches-green-cards-for-banks\/\">smaller the chip<\/a>, the less polluting it is. So, Idemia\u2019s self-designed chips are small, and instead of being wrapped in plastic, they\u2019re wrapped in recycled PVC.\u201d In the next few years, the card itself will be fully biodegradable. Idemia is also putting together plans to make the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.idemia.com\/infog-greenpay-it-doesnt-cost-earth\">personalization and packaging of cards more sustainable<\/a> to reduce excess inventory of packages and cards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The decline of cash<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have ever taken out cash or paid at a cash register, you have most likely seen the logo of Diebold Nixdorf, a worldwide producer of financial and retail technology. That may soon change following a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dieboldnixdorf.com\/en-us\/banking\/solutions\/sustainable_banking\">company-wide commitment to take action for sustainability<\/a>: \u201cLarge and oversized branches no longer fit the model in most circumstances, but that doesn\u2019t mean bankers should abandon them altogether.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the wake of the 2020 pandemic, maintaining a presence in the physical world has become complicated \u2013 but people still need access to cash. Diebold Nixdorf has suggested optimizing the footprint of physical branches with new ATM solutions, where \u201ca modern self-service terminal with enhanced functionality can take the place of a traditional teller, providing everything from cash in\/cash out to bill payments, money transfers and other complex transactions.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These terminals also incorporate an enclosed loop cycle where the stock of cash is being replenished by customers, reducing the need for the supply chain that\u2019s normally needed to stock up ATMs \u2013 resulting in a carbon saving of <a href=\"https:\/\/image.e.dieboldnixdorf.com\/lib\/fe651570776307787413\/m\/8\/DN_Guide_Sustainable-Banking_FA-2_20200505.pdf\">4 million kg over the network&#8217;s lifetime<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Doconomy\u2019s carbon calculator<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Calculating the carbon impact of anything from a purchase to a business can be a stumbling block for many \u2013 something that Swedish fintech <a href=\"https:\/\/doconomy.com\">Doconomy<\/a> is setting out to change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Doconomy has enjoyed massive success in Sweden with its sustainable credit card, which restricts your spending according to the carbon footprint of your purchases \u2013 an innovation created a whole new market almost overnight. It was an idea that was too good to stay in Sweden alone, resulting in Doconomy looking into how it would expand towards a global footprint.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is when Doconomy approached us at Vacuumlabs to help them build the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.2030calculator.com\/\">2030 Calculator<\/a>, which helps brands around the world and their customers quantify the impact of their shopping decisions on the world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Doconomy already has the \u00c5land Index live in the seven countries to calculate the carbon footprint impact on transaction, with the 2030 Calculator, a simple online calculator that will process your production data and show you how your choices impact the world around you, calculations are also made on the product level. It\u2019s a precise idea, one that has the power to deliver real change \u2013 and you can learn more about how we built the calculator in our latest <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vacuumlabs.com\/projects\/doconomy_cs\">case study<\/a> or listen to our <a href=\"https:\/\/inside.vacuumlabs.com\/podcasts\/reduce-your-environmental-impact-using-doconomy-digital-tools\">interview with the founders of Doconomy.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What\u2019s your role in all this?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s worth remembering that every time you tap to pay, you\u2019re making an imprint on the environment, and the future. But with more fintechs leading on green initiatives, there\u2019s increasingly a shift away from choosing to help to simply choosing your approach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you have a project that can contribute to a better tomorrow and you could use some help and guidance with it, contact us at Vacuumlabs.

November 18th, 2020 marks the launch of Daylight, our latest portfolio venture that we\u2019ve been working on the last year. One of the co-founders of Vacuumlabs, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/ftacnik\/\">Matej Ftacnik<\/a>, is a long term supporter of the LGBT+ community in Slovakia and has been leading the effort to build a new venture in this space for quite some time<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of our venture-building initiatives, he came up with the idea of a bank that tackles the inherent problems of the LGBT+ community and in early 2020, he brought in the founding team <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/mr-rob-curtis\/\">Rob Curtis<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/billiesimmons\/\">Billie Simmons<\/a> \u2013 which has greatly contributed to the business ever since. After a period of intensive support and hands-on collaboration with Matej and the Vacuumlabs venture team, the Daylight team has received the necessary initial funding and technology resources to drive Daylight forward on its own.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matej continues to be involved as the Chairman of the Board for Daylight. Rob Curtis has said: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cWhat we love about Matej is that it took a Slovak activist to take a chance on building a company that would have such an impact on the LGBT+ community in the USA. Ultimately, without him, whatever impact we achieve as a business wouldn\u2019t be possible. And we are excited to work with him on the Board.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Vacuumlabs acts as the technology partner that is powering the development of Daylight&#8217;s digital banking platform alongside Visa and Marqeta. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cCombining the power of Vacuumlabs\u2019 world-class fintech engineering talent and our knowledge of the LGBT+ community in the US makes this the ideal partnership to build a major bank of affinity that helps LGBT+ people prepare for the future faster,\u201d says Billie Simmons.&nbsp;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Founded in 2020, Daylight is the first and only digital banking platform in the U.S. specifically designed for and by the LGBT+ community.

but also from a financial one, was for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/donald-j-hawkins\/\">Donald Hawkins<\/a> a starting gear for filling the gap in the market.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He could see how the community lacked financial literacy; they didn\u2019t understand how wealth building and money itself worked. Donald decided to make a change. To do this, he established the first neobank for black Americans, Boulevard, to meet the needs of the community. And this was an inherently inclusive initiative; every community is welcome to use Boulevard\u2019s services, regardless of race or color.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the 2nd episode of Banking on Air with Helene Panzarino, Donald Hawkins talks not only about systematic oppression of black Americans: he talks about the necessity of community banks and importance of the relationship between banks and customers. With the world changing, particularly due to the impact of COVID-19, everything is happening virtually.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, it\u2019s fair to say that traditional banking isn\u2019t possible anymore. In the past, banks were more transactional than relationship-oriented; but a saturated market requires more than good features.

However, attempting to incorporate innovation into these organizations can prove to be disastrous if not carefully handled.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nektarios Liolios has worked closely with corporates, startups and investors over the last ten years. He set up and led bootcamps, founded competitions for startups, and facilitated cooperations between fintech and financial institutions. How did this all turn out? In all honesty, it was both frustrating and difficult.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>\u201cTalking to people at these institutions, looking them in the eye, knowing that they know what the right thing to do is and then seeing that they didn\u2019t want to take these steps because it was going to be too hard or it wasn\u2019t politically expedient&#8230; Everyone concedes \u2013 I know what you\u2019re saying, but that\u2019s not what we\u2019re going to do. I just couldn\u2019t stand having the same conversation all over again.\u201d<\/em> &#8211; Nektarios Liolios<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Understanding how innovation works<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a number of reasons why innovation fails to work in big organizations such as banks. According to Nektarios, part of the problem is that traditional banks don\u2019t understand how innovation works, what its core purpose actually is.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is <em>not<\/em> simply saying: \u201cLet\u2019s build an innovation lab because it\u2019s something we should have.\u201d Secondly, outcomes from the innovation process can\u2019t be plugged into a spreadsheet model: there\u2019s always a strong element of uncertainty. Yet banks expect immediate results; they are looking for instant ROI. But innovation isn\u2019t a box-ticking exercise. It\u2019s about doing some heavy lifting, it\u2019s about understanding that resources dedicated to innovation might not deliver immediate results. They need to accept that it is not ROI, but R&amp;D.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>\u201cThis is where frustration kicks in. Super-sophisticated organizations often have a highly simplistic view of how innovation works. And that\u2019s a major part of the problem. People just weren\u2019t prepared to do more. And the doing \u2018more\u2019 is going into this more deeply, making structural changes.\u201d<\/em> &#8211; Nektarios Liolios<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Putting a strategy in place<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another key element is putting an innovation strategy and approach in place. Should a bank decide to innovate, there are a number of ways to achieve this<strong> <\/strong>\u2013 taking a stake in an existing business or acquiring a company, or leading the innovation in-house.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>\u201cIt\u2019s all great if you know why you\u2019re doing what you\u2019re doing. But that presupposes you have a strategy. Even now, ten years down the line, since this emerged as a buzzword, I haven\u2019t yet seen people getting a handle on innovation strategy.\u201d<\/em> &#8211; Nektarios Liolios<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Should a bank decide to engage with a fintech startup, that cooperation may not be plain sailing. Some tie-ups work out, but for many it\u2018s a painful process because they don\u2019t really understand how to engage with the seed-stage company and the full scope of the value that they could build from this. Even acquiring a company can end up in failure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>\u201cThere are companies who have successfully built startups themselves or bought companies and integrated their solutions. But the majority don\u2019t understand that the moment you buy a startup, that startup dies because their CEO wasn\u2019t cut out to be a banking executive.\u201d<\/em> &#8211; Nektarios Liolios<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Would you like to find out more about the creation of fintech industry and Nektarios\u2019s real-life experiences of working with both fintechs and banks?

But like finding the perfect pebble on a large beach, it sometimes takes another pair of eyes to spot the ideas and features that have the most potential.<br><br>For Swedish fintech <a href=\"https:\/\/doconomy.com\">Doconomy<\/a>, the collaboration with Vacuumlabs accelerated their journey to making a global impact. We recognized Doconomy\u2019s tremendous potential, and helped it build its most crucial innovation into a world-class product: the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.2030calculator.com\/\">2030 Calculator<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How did it happen?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/doconomy.com\">Doconomy<\/a> was already a success before it approached us, with industry recognition in the form of multiple major awards for its pioneering credit card. This had a unique feature: a built-in system that calculated carbon limits for its credit card users and customers.<br><br>This concept had turned the industry on its head: rather than promoting consumerism, it limited the ability to spend not on available credit, but on the levels of CO2 emission caused by the owner\u2019s purchases.<br><br>Doconomy quickly became a huge success but it needed to have its message accelerated internationally. The potential was clear but although Doconomy had its vision and its eyes on the big picture, it was looking for a partner to support in the next steps.<br><br>This is where Vacuumlabs came in. We instantly saw the potential global reach of Doconomy\u2019s ideas, and we started looking at ways to help Doconomy create a product that could be made available to anyone, regardless of their geographic location. And that\u2019s when we spotted the shiny pebble &#8211; the key idea that Doconomy\u2019s innovation hinged on.<br><br>The methodology that Doconomy had created for the 2030 Calculator was incredibly interesting, giving brands and users the ability to dive deep into the specifics of a product and measure its carbon impact.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What did it take?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After extensive discussions with Doconomy, we designed a technological solution for the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.2030calculator.com\/\">2030 Calculator<\/a>. The result of a 3-month collaboration between 3 Vacuumlabs developer guides and Doconomy\u2019s design theme, this web-based service calculates the carbon impact of brands and merchandisers who are interested in climate change, and willing to bring transparency into their processes. By simply entering a product\u2019s production data, the 2030 Calculator returns the CO2 emissions.<br><br>And because the 2030 Calculator is available via a web browser, Vacuumlabs has given Doconomy the ability to put it onto the global stage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cWorking with Vacuumlabs was a perfect match. We have worked with several providers over the time, but Vacuumlabs is actually the first one to realy act as a partner, because in this project, it&#8217;s not as much about the challenge we have in front of us in trying to solve this and enable brands to do this, as it&#8217;s important who we have by our side, trying to resolve this issue together.\u201d<em> \u2013\u00a0Mathias Wikstr\u00f6m, CEO, Doconomy<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is Planet Loyalty?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2030 Calculator is one component of <a href=\"https:\/\/planetloyalty.com\/\">Planet Loyalty<\/a> \u2013 an initiative with huge potential for change.<br><br>It\u2019s a loyalty program with one significant difference: its focus on brands\u2019 transparency and their carbon imprint. Transparency is already an important watchword \u2013 as we move forward, transparent relationships with customers are going to be the difference between brands making it or breaking it.<br><br>It\u2019s a key differentiator between businesses who conduct sustainable operations \u2013\u00a0and those who don\u2019t. With every aspect of the supply chain coming under increased scrutiny from all quarters, it\u2019ll be the organizations who prioritize sustainability who will have a place in the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What\u2019s next for you?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our story is far from over.

Nektarios was there when fintech first emerged as a new force in technology \u2013 right when this industry first started to really gain traction.<br><br>He co-founded the first accelerator program for startups and the very first startup bootcamp for fintechs in London. Hot on the heels of London came bootcamps in major hubs such as Singapore, New York and Dubai. However, ten years of working with big institutions such as major banks \u2013 and trying to bring in true innovation \u2013 has ultimately proved so frustrating for Nektarios that he has decided to step back from the industry.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As he describes in this episode, banks just weren\u2019t prepared to bring in true, effective innovation. According to Nektarios, most don\u2019t really understand how innovation works. They are reluctant to invest either time or money in R&amp;D&nbsp;and often fail to understand the value that partnering with startups across various stages can bring.<br><br>And even those times when banking executives grasped the necessity for a strategic framework to support innovation \u2013 and knew what the process needed to be on paper \u2013 that innovation simply didn\u2019t happen. Largely it was because it was too much for a stretch for them to deliver, given pushbacks from key stakeholders. Or on occasion, their commitment to innovation was halfhearted as the team leads would soon be shuffled off into a different role in any case.<br><br>A major source of frustration, for sure \u2013 but can it be overcome?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get the lowdown on Nektarios\u2019 experiences with fintechs and innovation, listen to our podcast <em>Banking on Air<\/em>!

If you look at health, automotive, any other industry.&nbsp; This is part of who they are, what they do. In financial services, none of this. Maybe a focus group, if you&#8217;re lucky. But usually building your products and services is looking at what the competition does and doing it a little bit better. Tweaking it here and there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino<\/strong><strong> <\/strong><strong>[00:17]<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Welcome to my first episode of the Vacuumlabs Banking on Air podcast. I&#8217;m delighted to say that for my inaugural event, I&#8217;m joined by that FinTech fossil that most of the world knows and loves, Nektarios Liolios.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nektarios Liolios<\/strong><strong> <\/strong><strong>[00:32]<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does this mean that you&#8217;ve undug me under some rock, from under a rock. Hello! Hi, Helene.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino<\/strong><strong> <\/strong><strong>[00:38]<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nektarios it is wonderful to be with you on my first day, as it were,&nbsp; on this job. We&#8217;ve had other experiences where I&#8217;ve been with you on the first day of a job,&nbsp; and we can talk about that a little bit later. But before we get into that, where there might be two people on the whole planet who don&#8217;t know who you are, maybe you can introduce yourself as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nektarios Liolios [00:56]<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. jeez, I spent 17 years of my life in the corporate world in financial services under various guises<strong>.<\/strong> And then I joined this crazy bunch of innovators called Innotribe, which was a novel, weird movement, more than a company department that was looking to help the wider financial industry to innovate. And that was an eye-opening moment and one of those moments you remember in your life, where there was no going back. Innotribe was visionary. We had the budgets and the freedom to do crazy things, exploratory things, experimental things, at a time when FinTech wasn&#8217;t a word. So we actually started educating ourselves and educating the industry about what the new technologies and the new business models would bring and how the industries could benefit from that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;This was at Swift, the messaging network, right? So a community mechanism that had the remit to do something for the community. We started with a conference. We did BizDev in the sense of trying to find the right people within the financial institutions who understood innovation or were in charge of innovation. Usually they didn&#8217;t have an innovation title at that time because we&#8217;re talking 2009, 2010. And little by little, we started seeing startups and other innovators, and we decided to build a mechanism that connects the two, so we did a competition. Because nobody did it at the time. FinTech, as I said, wasn&#8217;t a word. And I always amuse people by telling the story that the first person I hired later for startup bootcamp FinTec, the accelerator, thought that FinTech meant technology from Finland. No joke. Long story short, we did some amazing things with other startup competitions, over three years. So big global mechanisms for some amazing companies in the process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then we decided we want to be closer to these startups. We were looking to build the first industry collaborative, industry driven accelerator program for financial services companies. And we wanted to do this in partnership with startup bootcamp as one of the accelerator organizations in Europe with a great reputation. And I ended up switching sides and doing it outside of the industry. And there was the first moment where I stepped into the entrepreneurial world. Started setting up Bootcamp Fintech in London as an industry focused corporate innovation driven accelerator program with a bunch of banks and financial institutions sponsoring it. And then every nine months we would launch a new city around the world, London, Singapore, New York, Mumbai, Mexico City, Dubai . It&#8217;s huge. It&#8217;s everywhere. So for five years, that was my life. And at the end of 2018, I thought I&#8217;ve had enough. So I packed my bags and left.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino<\/strong><strong>&nbsp; <\/strong><strong>[03:38]&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was very fortunate to have met you in 2014. When I was at Innovate UK, the UK trade body for FinTech, when people were just getting to grips with that new word, FinTech. And kudos to the fintechs and whoever made that up, they should own that. So I was involved with that new FinTech and all of what that would mean in 2014, and I came out of funding for high growth companies, And I consider myself a recovering banker. So we&#8217;ve all come at this FinTech thing from different angles and came together again, as you said at Rainmaking or in the next iteration of the accelerator, when we worked together on the Colab. Now, I want to go back to some of the things that you mentioned, because you spoke about community and you spoke about FinTech.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You spoke about corporates and innovation, and that&#8217;s something that we came together also to try and see if we could create meaningful commercial engagement for tier ones and the FinTech community. But I have to ask, and I know other people will be wondering too, with all that behind you, with all of the entrepreneurial side of startup bootcamp, with all of that momentum and all of the firsts that you were involved with, what was it that made you decide to step out of it in 2018?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nektarios Liolios [04:55]<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s the official version, but that&#8217;s not what you want to hear. The personal side was, I was tired. I was tired physically. I was tired emotionally building for five years, firefighting for five years, because when you run a small business and we grew the business from 10 people to 20 &#8211; 50 people, but still. But ultimately I was tired of the industry. We decided to launch Startupbootcamp FinTech as a program that actually helps the slow moving animals that are the banks to understand the different steps that need to take across the different stages of innovation, trying to get them to understand innovation strategy, the importance of experimentation, but also the importance of commercial engagements and all these things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But after five years, ultimately after eight years in that space, talking to people in the institutions, looking them in the eye, knowing that they know what the right things to do are, and then seeing that they didn&#8217;t want to do them because it was too hard or it wasn&#8217;t politically the right thing to do, or because their objectives were different, because they didn&#8217;t do this for the cause they did this for themselves and I just got super frustrated. I literally just couldn&#8217;t stand having yet another conversation. So everybody says, I know what you&#8217;re saying, but we&#8217;re not going to do it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino<\/strong><strong> <\/strong><strong>[06:08]&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Listening to you, say it again, even though I know I&#8217;ve experienced it. And I was reading something in one of the LinkedIn channels where people were saying, &#8220;Oh, these are the five things that innovators need to do. And innovation departments need to do this. &#8220;And every time you read it, you think we all know what people need to do, but as you&#8217;ve just said, they just don&#8217;t do it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I wonder also, and we&#8217;ve had this conversation before about whether or not it&#8217;s a tier one or is a tier two, or it&#8217;s a lower tier, the lower level of financial services. What happened ultimately was, I think, that&nbsp; the tier ones started to do it for themselves. And then to set up internal accelerators, call them whatever you want to call them &#8211; Incubators, accelerators, moonshots, slingshots, navel gazing whatever it might be &#8211; thinking that they drunk enough of the Kool-Aid so they could figure out how to do it themselves and they had enough of working with the external providers of these services or being an entrepreneur in residence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And again, just thinking, \u2018we&#8217;ve learned enough, we can do it ourselves\u2019. And so they were also thinking, \u2018we&#8217;ve moved on from that\u2019. And we&#8217;re not as responsive, but at the same time I think the fintechs started to grow much more quickly than incumbents ever thought that they would. And they hadn&#8217;t crossed that bridge where they could say, \u2018they don&#8217;t need the crumbs from the table anymore\u2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the fintechs are not waiting for you to give them something. They&#8217;ve moved on. And my own feeling was that&#8217;s when I got interested in the smaller banks and then the community banks or building societies, and actually the whole idea behind community. And I think that&#8217;s something that we&#8217;ve explored and we will go on to explore.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d like to pick up on that because I said, we spoke about community innovation, financial services, and engagement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nektarios Liolios<\/strong><strong> <\/strong><strong>[07:58]&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a thing here that is looking back and we can now look over in my case, 10 years of this, right? There is something about banks being binary. It&#8217;s either one or the other, a lot of the decisions were being taken. Okay. Oh, we need an innovation lab. Let&#8217;s just build one. Not really understanding the purpose, the expected results, what successes. And it happened with pretty much everything. Oh, we need a head of innovation. Let&#8217;s just chuck the title innovation to somebody who had a business, this unit role or a biz dev role or corporate development or whatever it is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other thing is, because of that binary perspective, when things didn&#8217;t work out, people said, okay, we tried this, it didn&#8217;t work. Therefore innovation doesn&#8217;t work. Add to this, the fact that these things aren&#8217;t linear. You cannot predict where it will go. Some of it is, especially when it&#8217;s exploration or experimentation, that is just a part of things. Maybe this episode will take longer, but let me give you an example. When we started talking about the importance of startups, we tried to tell people: \u201cYou need to learn how to work with these innovators, because you will not be able to come up with these ideas, the business models or the technologies. But for an early stage startup, it&#8217;s all going to be learning for you because the startup will not be mature enough to interface, to get through your procurement process.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we had this slogan that said from ROI to R &amp; D. Tried to get people to understand, move away from your return on investment mindset and understand that this is going to be research and development money. It&#8217;s pure research. And part of it will be useless. And part of it will be the nugget that you need to get to the next stage. And you need to build the capacity, capability, because the financial industry doesn&#8217;t do R &amp; D. If you look at health automotive, any other industry.&nbsp; This is part of who they are, what they do. In financial services, none of this. Maybe a focus group, if you&#8217;re lucky. But usually building your products and services is looking at what the competition does and doing it a little bit better. Tweaking it here and there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino<\/strong><strong> <\/strong><strong>[09:49]&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s no budget for failure either to play around with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nektarios Liolios [09:52]<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, this is all part of R &amp; D right? Now, when we are out in the market with this message, people go: &#8220;Oh, we understand, we need to do proof of concept .&#8221; And all that they say great. Pilots, proof of concept without an expectation on returns at that stage. Guess what? Five years later you meet the same people going: &#8220;We&#8217;ve done a hundred POCs&#8221; and you go: \u201cAnd?\u201d And they go: &#8220;We&#8217;re doing innovation&#8221;. No you&#8217;re doing the first slice of innovation. But where&#8217;s the thinking beyond that, it&#8217;s this really naive thinking of, we have to do one thing, tick the box and then move on or expect something to happen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this is where the frustration comes in. And it&#8217;s very simple, super sophisticated organizations, highly technological organizations, having a very simplistic, naive view on how innovation works. And this is part of the problem. This was part of the reason why I got fed up because people weren&#8217;t prepared to do more and the more is deeper, the more is structural, the more has to do with shareholder expectations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino<\/strong><strong> <\/strong><strong>[10:49]&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m thinking about how large organizations engage with the FinTech community. So what are the models of engagement and what&#8217;s come out of that. You either have people investing in you, you have people acquiring, you have people seeing you as a vendor, then you have someone in partnership that has some of their own agenda and wants to work with you in a certain way. But also we know that there&#8217;s a way to work together and have some co-creation. So has that grown up enough now? And is that more driven by the fintechs rather than the incumbents? Is the way that we engage, does that have to change for actually a real commercial engagement to be affected?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you don&#8217;t engage and genuinely engage in a commercial way with the fintechs to co-create something new, are you at risk of dying out? You&#8217;d be like a dinosaur.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nektarios Liolios [11:37]<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I haven&#8217;t seen it fundamentally evolve. Because you mentioned a few very common ones, right. We could buy a company. We could invest in a company. We could use them as a vendor. It&#8217;s all great if you know why you&#8217;re doing what you&#8217;re doing, but that presumes strategy. And this is the thing that even 10 years down the line, since the emergence of that as a buzz theme, I haven&#8217;t seen people understanding innovation strategy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I haven&#8217;t seen organizations which recognize that. In order for this to work, the business needs to be on board. And we built a co-lab together because we&#8217;ve recognized that it will start. It has to start with the business seeing the necessity, not some innovation kind of person going: &#8220;Oh, this season, I&#8217;m interested in blockchain&#8221;. And you go: &#8220;Why?&#8221; And they go: &#8220;Because it&#8217;s cool. And because we get to travel to Silicon Valley.&#8221; Because that&#8217;s really it.&nbsp; Reality is, it was of no relevance to the business units.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino [12:32]<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;ve been doing it for 18 months before they moved on to another innovation department. And I say to some of the innovation people, you are lovely people, and I like working with a lot of you, but I didn&#8217;t feel it at times. It was a bit like: &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m done here. I&#8217;ve attempted the innovation thing. I haven&#8217;t had the backing from my organization. I don&#8217;t have a space to fail. I don&#8217;t have a remit to actually get<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>something done. So I&#8217;m going somewhere else.&#8221; There&#8217;s shareholder pressure, there&#8217;s target pressure in every financial institution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s just how innovation fits into that. And I think what&#8217;s happened here, in the world, the whole idea behind accelerating innovation has really come to the fore. If you don&#8217;t have a strategy, you need to get one. If you did have a strategy, a digital strategy, then you really need to get your skates on because COVID has pushed everybody&#8217;s digital strategy and transformation to the extreme.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nektarios Liolios<\/strong> <strong>[13:23]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a couple of examples. There are organizations who got a little bit better at it and people trying to copy, which isn&#8217;t necessarily a bad thing. Part of it is also that the startups, the fintechs have matured. But still there&#8217;s, I would say, the majority of organizations still don&#8217;t really understand how to engage with an early stage company, with the seed stage company, with A series, B series, and the value that they will get out of the different stages, which is still a problem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to solve a problem, if you have a problem in the business and you look strategically at it and you go, okay, how will I solve this? So if you see a new revenue opportunity, how will I get there? At some point, there needs to be this moment where you think: &#8221; Do I do it myself, or can I partner with somebody who&#8217;s already figured it out? And if this part is out in the market, how do I interface with them technologically, but also from a process perspective? My processes, procurement legal compliance, la-di-da set up in a way that I can do this quickly and benefit from the speed that this other company does.&#8221; If you bring in people from the relevant departments on board, early on, you will actually get through this easier than if you&#8217;ve got the innovation team operating in isolation, then throw it in front of the legal person and they go,\u2019 why should I care?\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So people aren&#8217;t incentivized enough to do it. And this hasn&#8217;t changed. Some of the procurement processes have changed for early stage experimentation. Yeah. Great. And some banks are better at it, some banks have got this mindset: &#8220;We can co-create, let&#8217;s put a company that has a solution right next to the business unit for six months, get them to work together on the problem, figuring out the gaps and then get our process people to make sure that we can bridge these gaps.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, it works. JP Morgan&#8217;s a good example. And there are the companies like Goldman&#8217;s who have successfully built startups themselves or bought companies and incorporated the solutions. But the majority don&#8217;t understand that the moment you buy a startup, the startup dies because the CEO didn&#8217;t set out to be a senior executive in a bank.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They wanted to run a business because usually, in a bizarre way, they wanted to change the world by introducing back office efficiencies or whatever it is. So&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think the organizations have figured it out<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino<\/strong><strong> <\/strong><strong>[15:30]&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I&#8217;m listening to you, I&#8217;m thinking, and right now we&#8217;re in a situation that&#8217;s almost mission critical for people to figure out if it&#8217;s because of the exposure of the front, middle and back end that occurred with COVID, particularly when it came to SMEs and SMBs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So depending on where you are in the world, this highlighted the fact that it wasn&#8217;t good enough; what was available, wasn&#8217;t good enough. And you weren&#8217;t going to be able to give somebody the finance that they needed to be available, and to have it ready for them in a way they can consume it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And somebody else was just going to step into the breach. There&#8217;ll be an alternative provider, for example, that will take that space. Is this one of those moments where we can actually say: \u201cMaybe this is the thing that will open the door for people to genuinely understand that they need to undo the learning and to take a different position and see how to really work with the FinTech community to do some good?\u201d We&#8217;re all here to do some good. But we have to look into our cultural legacy as much as our tech and our infrastructure legacy and make some changes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nektarios Liolios<\/strong> <strong>[16:36]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s so difficult to say. For me, it&#8217;s baffling then in 2020, we&#8217;re talking about: &#8220;Oh, maybe SME banking is a space that will be the catalyst.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And guess what, when we talked in 2014 in the boot camp about what we were looking for, we said: \u201cLook, nobody cares about payments solution anymore, or yet another wallet.\u201d And even alternative lending for consumers was already quite saturated in the mature markets. We saw SME banking as a pioneering space.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where the real difference will come in. And we had companies doing great things coming through the accelerator that are now successful players in that space. But the incumbents? Six years down the line, I haven&#8217;t seen much.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino [17:16]<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when we talk about incumbents, is there a difference between the tier ones, the tier twos, the tier threes?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is it big boys and small boys or girls or people? I always feel that the \u2018just belows\u2019 have not been tainted yet by the process of going through some kind of innovation theater and thinking that they can do it themselves. And they also have more to risk, more to lose, but potentially more to gain, right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nektarios Liolios<\/strong> <strong>[<\/strong><strong>17:46]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. If you&#8217;re a smaller institution, you have this conundrum of you could be in the loop, but you may not have the same budget as a big one, so you can&#8217;t invest as much into one of the expensive players or the experimentation. But if you look at it globally, the banks that are usually a little bit smarter, it&#8217;s not the very big names, it&#8217;s the ones below, right? It&#8217;s interesting also to watch how emerging markets are much better at this than the established markets. And talk about consumer business, everybody will go back at some point and talk about&nbsp; the M-PESA in Kenya. Everybody will talk about micro-lending organizations in Latin America.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it goes beyond that. And I think it&#8217;s really interesting to see how some of the startups that are in&nbsp; the direct consumer space address these markets. I&#8217;m Greek, it&#8217;s well documented. Revolut has a huge presence in Greece, right? You don&#8217;t think about that. You don&#8217;t think that they&#8217;re one of the bigger players. But they&#8217;ve come into a space where, because of the Greek financial crisis and everything there was room to play. I have a feeling that little by little, some of the startups of 10 years ago, who are now unicorns, will start hogging the space. And the banks have probably to some extent given up on the consumer play and they think that with a corporate relationship and everything else, the treasury business, whatever it is, that the business is safe. But ultimately I think little by little, this will be eroded as well. We&#8217;ve been saying this for years, people don&#8217;t care. It still feels safe. COVID has shaken up things a bit, we don&#8217;t really know how this is going to pan out. Nobody would have thought that Zoom would be the standard means of communication seven months down the line. So I think it&#8217;s interesting<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino<\/strong><strong> <\/strong><strong>[19:23]<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, nobody would have thought that PayPal for the over <strong>55s<\/strong> would be the main way to pay for things, but that&#8217;s, what&#8217;s happening in COVID. So,&nbsp; the other thing is that big tech has always been there. And it&#8217;s been there from the consumer&#8217;s point of view and now it&#8217;s moving into the business space as well. We always said that the thing that big tech was was the elephant in the room. Banks needed to be afraid of the fintechs as much as they did to be afraid of big tech. And now it&#8217;s making its move.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nektarios Liolios<\/strong> <strong>[19:48]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you know what, you used PayPal and you talked about it as a startup. And a lot of banks refer&nbsp; to a company like PayPal as a startup. I think of PayPal as an old hat because there&#8217;s so many new year&#8217;s solutions in the market. But also I&#8217;ve got another 15 months until my 55th. So I can do that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino<\/strong><strong> <\/strong>[20:08]&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m already taking 25% of my pension. No, actually that\u2019s fine. &nbsp; We&#8217;re asking all our guests to explain, as in that saying, if you could explain something to your grandmother, that means you know it very well. Because we all know there are lots of buzzwords and there are lots of people when they&#8217;re talking about AI machine learning, for example, and that they don&#8217;t really know what they&#8217;re talking about.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;re just saying anything with AI we know is very, everyone&#8217;s talking about right now. So in our first podcast together and then our first podcast under my umbrella, if you had to explain FinTech, successful FinTech corporate engagement, to your grandmother in one minute, what would that sound like?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nektarios Liolios<\/strong> <strong>[20:45]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should have prepared me for that question. Now I have to think on my feet. FinTech, corporate engagement?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino [20:54]&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Successful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nektarios Liolios<\/strong> <strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><strong>[20:55]<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. Yeah. The big banks don&#8217;t give&#8230; No, maybe I should address my grandmother. Dear grandma, Helene. You, this is tricky, Helene, this is tricky. Maybe forget the grandmother. Ultimately corporate startup engagement means that there&#8217;s a lot of technology out there that allows us to do amazing things. And the banks don&#8217;t really know how to use it, partly because they don&#8217;t care about their clients that much and partly because they&#8217;re just incapable of actually understanding what new business models are possible based on this technology. Crowdlending, which is something that a lot of people do now, is a business model that&#8217;s enabled by new technology. A lot of the things that we see and maybe, sorry, that&#8217;s not the right way to answer your question.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But one of the things that really frustrates me in the conversation around FinTech is people get too stuck on the technology piece and blockchain, AI or whatever&#8230;it\u2019s ultimately irrelevant ,because the big thing in all of this is that me as a consumer, me as a corporate, me as a small business, I get better financial services.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve got problems that have been solved because there&#8217;s a new business model that is possible because of the technology. I can get an account open faster. I can get a loan faster. I can prove my credentials for credit score in a better way. Something that reflects my life. I think an easy way to describe this is maybe to go to your grandmother and say, if you were to go to a bank and ask for a loan, the bank would probably send your way because you live on a small pension.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s all there is. And nobody would know dear grand-mama that you&#8217;ve got 3 billion, Instagram followers in this episode<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino [22:30]<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You hid 3 million under your mattress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nektarios Liolios<\/strong> [22:33]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There you go. So maybe you need to work on that question. I don&#8217;t know. The grandmother and FinTech, corporate integration,&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino<\/strong><strong> <\/strong>[22:43]&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot of FinTech happening in that space. E<strong>lder tech<\/strong> is the new black. So they ignore the $8 trillion global spends, at their peril. Really? Yeah. I think we definitely overstayed our welcome on this topic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nektarios Liolios<\/strong> <strong>[22:54]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have we? We just started!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino<\/strong><strong> <\/strong><strong>[22:57]<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No. We&#8217;ve obviously overstayed our welcome.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nektarios Liolios<\/strong> <strong>[22:59]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you want to ask me what I&#8217;m doing now?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino [23:00]<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I said it&#8217;s interesting that we ended on FinTech as the technology of any age, that is the enabler for the things that people want to do in their financial, and in other parts of their life. That&#8217;s what FinTech should be, It should be the enabler for what we want to do, whether it was the ATM in 1967, or it was Diners card when your man couldn&#8217;t pay his bill and they didn&#8217;t take a check, or the other old technologies from the telegraph, the telegram. It goes on and on, and they just enabled people to get on with their lives more simply, at a better cost and with more transparency. And finance was one of the things that they had to do. Somehow we managed to make it something bigger than it was or that it is. So it&#8217;s nice that we came back to the fact that technology should be there to enable us to do what we want to do with our financial services and that finance is not the thing that becomes the overriding element. It&#8217;s actually what we want to do with it. Thank you so much for being with me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nektarios Liolios<\/strong> <strong>[<\/strong><strong>23:59]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for having me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Helene Panzarino [24:00]<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it was a wonderful way to kick off.

A product that we believe will help to support Doconomy&#8217;s powerful vision: to give both consumers and businesses the digital tools that they need to understand and reduce the environmental impact of their consumption.

Can you please introduce yourselves for the audience and let&#8217;s get started.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mathias <\/strong><strong>Wikstr\u00f6m<\/strong><strong> <\/strong><strong>[01:17]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you so much for having us today, Marcel. So my name is&nbsp; Matthias and I&#8217;m currently the CEO of Doconomy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Johan Pihl [01:24]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Johan. I&#8217;m head of innovation at Doconomy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo [01:28]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many people might not have heard about Doconomy. What is the elevator pitch or what&#8217;s the explanation to your six year old daughter or son? How do you explain&nbsp; what Doconomy does.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mathias <\/strong><strong>Wikstr\u00f6m<\/strong><strong> [01:38]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Doconomy aims to provide digital solutions to help us all live in a more sustainable way. And the bottom line is, we believe that people want to contribute to solve the climate crisis, to save the planet. And most of us are sometimes hindered by insufficient tools to do so.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Johan Pihl <\/strong><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><strong>[01:55]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s almost we connect your financial life to the impact on the planet. And we think that type of awareness understanding, especially how your consumption impacts the planet is a very good starting point for change. We think that individuals, especially consumers, have a opportunity to accelerate, the shift towards a sustainable future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo [02:17]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. So basically what you&#8217;re doing is you&#8217;re looking at people&#8217;s financial history and financial behavior and trying to match that to\u00a0 their aspirational goals of sustainability and really keeping the planet alive for future generations. Is that a fair summary?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Johan Pihl [02:32] .<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The insight is that everything you buy has impact on the planet and , you need to understand that impact and you need to understand. your carbon footprint linked to consumption, to make more informed purchase decisions over time. That&#8217;s what we want to achieve.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mathias <\/strong><strong>Wikstr\u00f6m<\/strong><strong> [02:47]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So basically the way we do it today is in three legs. So one leg is our mobile banking service in Sweden. That&#8217;s called, Do everyday climate action, which is a mobile banking service in part similar to many others with one very important point of difference.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it is that the climate is as relevant in everything, in every transaction and your savings account, in the way you can offset, in the way you can calculate your impact. And these calculations we use in the mobile bank, cooking service , we also sell our secret source to others because we understand that to tackle this problem, we need to engage many people in a lot of organizations. So we enabled any bank, in the world to use our methodology, to also engage an explain to their clients, the impact of every purchase. And on top of that,&nbsp; we have enabled every brand to calculate the carbon footprint of their products which is an extremely important an d&nbsp; cmponent, if we are to enable carbon labeling on products, which would be a way to also educate consumers around the impact of their lifestyle choices already on the shelf.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s the short pitch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo [03:58]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Was that the initial plan? to be\u00a0 provider to others, to other banks, to other suppliers? Or did you just start off with do or the first bank product and figure it out as you went?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Johan Pihl [04:08]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We started with a concept. Mathias and I, we have a background in marketing and advertising. So we were very convinced on a conceptual level of the type of service that we wanted to provide.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we realized that&nbsp; one and two years ago, we were. pioneers&nbsp; in an undefined market space. So, realizing that we also felt the need to accelerate, and help expand the very market where our service was supposed to be relevant. We decided, early on that, developing a business to business offering was very much in line with our longterm strategic, goal. Basically building the very market that we, try to be part of.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mathias <\/strong><strong>Wikstr\u00f6m<\/strong><strong> [04:47]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think&nbsp; it&#8217;s a very interesting question. because&nbsp; the feedback we&#8217;re getting and to build on what you are saying is that,&nbsp; per se, we are&nbsp; creating the market. We&#8217;re creating the space.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we&#8217;re also enabling competitors to enter into the same space. But we choose to see it rather as collaborators than competitors. And sometimes we meet people out of a financing perspecitve that say why aren&#8217;t you crazy? You&#8217;re giving away your secrets to others. They will compete with you. And by saying that we understand that these are not the investors we should talk to because they think that we can save e verything through one component, one solution, one platform, one company. And that&#8217;s not the case. It has taken a long time and many companies and many people to get into position we are with the problem we&#8217;re facing in order to tackle that we need to engage a lot of energy and&nbsp; a lot of enthusiasm and a lot of knowledge to enable the insights needed for people to understand the impact that they have. But also the opportunities that a change of lifestyle or other purchase decisions can lead to out of a positive perspective. We&#8217;re not here to judge, we&#8217;re here to help.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Johan Pihl [05:57]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think there&#8217;s a great sense. Going back to this decision of actually developing a business to business offering<s> <\/s>and per se, inviting competitors, you have to realize&nbsp; the long term purpose there addressing climate change is a huge undertaking requires, a multitude of, companies, brands, governments coming together. So for us to, offer this ability to measure climate impact on transaction level and also creating a standard around that is what we felt was needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo [06:29]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So this sort of reminds me of how now governments around the world are trying to establish infrastructure to support a sustainability. So it&#8217;s not really about just competitors in the market space, trying to, who&#8217;s going to build the best solar panel, but it&#8217;s rather about the governments around the world trying to build the systems, the energy grids to support a more democratic and more distributed system of infrastructure, which it doesn&#8217;t rely on a singular player and how you&#8217;re describing your system or the way you&#8217;re classifying things, it reminds me a bit of that. You&#8217;re not obviously a government institution, but&nbsp; there&#8217;s an infrastructure play here. Very much like we&#8217;re seeing with open banking around the world where banks are not almost the having to become more open to integrate others or to enable the creation of backs that weren&#8217;t possible in the past. I obviously have read up a lot on Doconomy when we started working together I learned a lot, but can you give a bit of a description of how that calculations works and how you do it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What the, maybe they&#8217;ll just say, the secret sauce is, but how it&#8217;s all put together?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mathias <\/strong><strong>Wikstr\u00f6m<\/strong><strong> [07:36]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We try to make the most out of the data at hand and, our ambition is threefold.&nbsp; firstly, we wanted to provide a&nbsp; calculation that everyone could use and everyone could understand and in a very broad perspective. So it&#8217;s a very wide horizon where we can engage many people in understanding that every action has a reaction. In order to do that and to scale that seamlessly, we use the data that is within the transaction. And the transaction data tells us a few different things: who you are, where you&#8217;ve been shopping, how much you&#8217;ve been spending time and date and so forth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that data in mind, which it&#8217;s the category data, we graded each category making use of leading financial market data and in collaboration with the standard and poor, we put a carbon score on every transaction you made. So we know that it should have been in a floral shop. We can address that transaction with the impact by floral shops and dispense that you have done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or if you are the gas station, we know that as well. What we don&#8217;t know is if you&#8217;ve been buying gas in the floral shop, Then you would have to recategorize that yourself, otherwise you would get the for the carbon score on that specific transaction. Next level of course would be to connect the individual companiesTcarbon score to the very transaction at that specific company, which is, short term, of course product development. And the third layer would be to calculate the carbon footprint for the products, the line item data on the receipts. However, then we&#8217;re entering into another data stream.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then we&#8217;re leaving the transaction data and entering the receipt data. And there is also a few other challenges around that in regard to integrity and so forth. But that&#8217;s going to happen as well. So we&#8217;re very hopeful about that development. And, to enable that we developed the 2030 calculator. What is important to understand is that we&#8217;re trying to make use of existing the efficiencies in the existing systems too to care for the fragilities in the ecosystem. So we&#8217;re rewiring, what&#8217;s already out there, we&#8217;re taking the financial system and instead of putting a limit on your credits,&nbsp; we&#8217;re putting a limit on your credit using CO2 emissions, just as an example. And the 2030 calculator, which we had tremendous support from you guys at Vacuumlabs and working around, is the very key to unlocking the potential of carbon labeling on product level. Which would then be the third step out of connecting your consumption to your impact<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Johan Pihl [10:06]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just to add to that, I think we startew With the credit card, knowingly understanding that, there was a restricted access to, granular data, it&#8217;s meant only to provide data on category level. But we thought as a vehicle or tool that you use every day, that it was a great starting point for, establishing a dialogue with the user. We took the opportunity to reshape the credit card to something that would enable, the card holder to become more responsible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now we&#8217;re adding layers. The next big step for us is, receiving, receipt data, which means that you received it on product level. Now, what we realized when we start discussing that was that very few brands actually have these calculations in place. Being pioneers in this market space, we saw that we had no responsibility to provide a tool for brands to calculate the impact on product level. Which is now what we&#8217;re doing with the 2030 calculator, which is, something we, we built together with you guys.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s astonishing is that, honestly, we, couldn&#8217;t imagine the type of response we&#8217;re getting. So we&#8217;re having companies from all around the world, calling in, not only using the calculator, but, interested in&nbsp; co-creating an even bigger, stronger platform enabling brands to calculate on product level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s an extremely interesting situation. Now, as I said before, this is in line with our longterm business strategy&nbsp; so it becomes a more granular carbon footprint for each individual. Not only on transaction level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo [11:49]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I really liked about your approach from a business strategy perspective is you&#8217;re not trying to boil the ocean.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you will add&nbsp; immediately. Often when we speak to companies, when they come to us, they have a&nbsp; grant idea that they want to achieve. And when we ask about what&#8217;s the MVP, what&#8217;s the first thing that you need to build to move to the next step in your grant goal. And if that answer is well, all of it, all of it is the MVB that doesn&#8217;t really help because that doesn&#8217;t move anybody.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you have the funding to build something massive, it takes a tremendous amount of time to build it. And by the time you build it, the market might&#8217;ve already got in front of you. So what I really loved about the fact that you did build the calculator,&nbsp; it was a piece of the Lego puzzle that you guys wanted to build that fills in some of the gaps that you&#8217;re seeing now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you&#8217;re obviously moving towards the receipt level, but you&#8217;re not there yet. So you&#8217;re building sort of the frameworks and the Legos for it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Johan Pihl [12:45]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You talked about the infrastructure needed and&nbsp; this is all about the infrastructure. we cannot only look at our short term business, strategy. We need to look at how to accelerate the whole market. Because once we do that, our service becomes more relevant. So it&#8217;s an interesting way, I think, you could see this type of situation with the front runners like Tesla or any &nbsp; company that&#8217;s, first ones out actually, define that market space needs to have a responsibility on infrastructure level as well. So&nbsp; it&#8217;s not the typical business model. It&#8217;s purpose driven.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo [13:26]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So&nbsp; the calculator is out now, it&#8217;s going to be growing, it&#8217;s going to have the support of more brands and more companies. &nbsp; What&#8217;s gonna happen next? Without revealing the stuff that you don&#8217;t want your competitors to know.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mathias <\/strong><strong>Wikstr\u00f6m<\/strong><strong> [13:38]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that, It all comes down actually to a lot of brands engaging and more and more will do And that&#8217;s in a way , proving our point &#8211; it&#8217;s a whole infrastructure that needs to be rewired. And you already has the saying early on in the process. We were discussing some people, around the general ability to redirect the efforts of many.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So where do you think is the best place to be if there is a car speeding off a cliff, where is the best place to be to stop that car? Of course, it&#8217;s inside the car because we can pull the brakes. And that&#8217;s exactly the same rationale for the infrastructure. You need to be in the infrastructure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You need to be the infrastructure in order to direct it elsewhere. And that infrastructure consists of many stakeholders and brands are key components and drivers in that change. So the future of the 2030 calculator has two crucial components. At the time right now, we&#8217;re blown away by the success of it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there&#8217;s two components. One is of course&nbsp; the increase of data, the precision in the data and the richness in different&nbsp; data points. The other is the number of brands using the calculator to get results out of it. The results are all good, but the effects of the results is carbon labeling. And&nbsp; carbon labeling basically turns every product into the textbook for sustainable change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So from the inside of the infrastructure, more and more components in the very infrastructure are getting engaged around this. And by doing so it&#8217;s increasing the hit rate, the efficiencies and the relevance of the very calculator they use to drive this change. So it&#8217;s a good spiral. <s>I was also, I think that<\/s><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Johan Pihl <\/strong><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><strong>[15:22]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A big potential is<s> <\/s>offering certifications on different levels. So I would say that&#8217;s something we&#8217;re looking into. We&#8217;re also looking into different new aspects of measuring recycling policies or warranties and so on which is a really interesting potential. So things are happening.&nbsp; Honestly, it&#8217;s all about co-creating very dynamic and strong platform to help brands perform these calculations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the ideas is from feedback from brands, they are very eager to contribute to this platform. And that was the really, the initial idea was to get out there was something that would inspire others to help build.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mathias <\/strong><strong>Wikstr\u00f6m<\/strong><strong> [16:03]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the feedback we&#8217;ve had, we are attempted to rebrand it from the 2030 calculator to the 2030 collaborator, because basically that&#8217;s what it is. A platform for collaboration where different brands help each other to communicate carbon footprint in precision to every user, to every consumer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that is being at the very core of the infrastructure of consumption. We&#8217;ve been there with the transaction data out of a credit card perspective which is a very good vehicle for change, but we can also get on the price tag. Communicating not only the monetary value on the goods but also the impact on the planet of its production.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo [16:41]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So looking at this from the perspective of a founder who&#8217;s&nbsp; now just jumping onto the journey of starting something in the sustainability space. How would you see that they would start collaborating with you? Whether that&#8217;s a fintech or a, sustainable,\\ merchandise or product business, fashion business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How would they get started with you? How would they start collaborating with you as part of 2030 collaborator?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Johan Pihl [17:06]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that there&#8217;s definitely room for improving our platform, and I think there&#8217;s many startups and people out there that could think of ways of developing this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most important part is that any collaboration is to align well with the overarching purpose this, which is it&#8217;s for free,&nbsp; it cuts down on the times band or calculating on product level dramatically. We&#8217;re talking about a few minutes compared to many weeks per product. We have really stepped away from any business model that would think of making money on the calculation level, because, so that&#8217;s core to us. I think anyone that wants to contribute needs to understand that, we&#8217;re trying to create a standard. We&#8217;re trying to create a mutual understanding of how we could accelerate the capability of carbon labeling. That&#8217;s the most important issue,&nbsp; but there&#8217;s definitely room to develop, services that could, be part of this project, I&#8217;m quite sure .There&#8217;re also ideas around offsetting, obviously. That&#8217;s really interesting. We noticed also that there&#8217;s a really interesting connection to traceability. In terms of specifying traceability and those types companies that are really developing services around that could be really interesting. Once again, just to repeat myself, You need to align with the purpose.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You need to understand that it&#8217;s not about making money. in providing the tools for the calculation. You could definitely think of layers on top of that which could&nbsp; be profitable, but, not on creating the very standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo [18:46]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Switching gears ever&nbsp; so slightl,.<s> <\/s>you mentioned that&nbsp; we as Vacuumlabs helped you build out the part of the 2030 calculator. What was the thinking from you from an organizational perspective to start collaborating with an external partner like ourselves instead of potentially building this in house.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Johan Pihl [19:03]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve known about you for quite some time and you have been on top of our list, based on your experience in financial services. And I think that this type of project was actually perfect to be handled by an external partner. You have to understand that we are very much busy building our core service, which is especially the app that is connected to the credit card which is a huge undertaking in itself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we&#8217;re also developing our API for our business to business offering. So we identified early that this platform or this calculator would be an excellent project to partner up with Vacuumlabs. And that was a perfect match, I think.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mathias <\/strong><strong>Wikstr\u00f6m<\/strong><strong> [19:44]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think it&#8217;s important also to remember, we have with several providers over the time, but Vacuumlabs is actually the first one that we regard as a partner, because&nbsp; in this project, which is a very tough task,&nbsp; it&#8217;s a hard nut to crack, it&#8217;s not as much about the challenge we have in front of us in trying to solve this and enable brands to do this, as it&#8217;s important who we have by ourselves, trying to resolve this issue.&nbsp; In all fairness, Without the skillsets and the capabilities of Vacuumlabs, we wouldn&#8217;t be&nbsp; in such a good place that we are now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we are extremely grateful for the collaboration and we are super excited about what&#8217;s to come. Because once you find some partner that understands, your needs and your ambitions and the challenges ahead someone that fully understands that and commit to addressing them together with you, you should really cling on to that partner because that partnership itself has tremendous value even before addressing the next challenging issue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Johan Pihl [20:47]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes to add to it, I think that for us, we believe that it&#8217;s a question of speed. and quality. And we worked with many external developers and it&#8217;s either or. &nbsp; And with Vacuumlabs, we believed that we have, <strong>speed<\/strong> and quality. And speed is essential here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When building something like this, for us, if it took a year, it would be useless. We need to act now,&nbsp; We&#8217;re building it because we&#8217;re the first ones to do it.&nbsp; We entered the market early, we used to do it in a bit of face or prototype and we built from there. So we&#8217;re not afraid of launching concepts that then go into further development.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But for that, you need to find a partner that understands&nbsp; the rules of the game so to speak. A<s> dn dn we, <\/s>we are definitely doing that. And, for that unit speed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo [21:37]<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you very much for that. We&#8217;re so happy that we really just brought the value you needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m really so happy about the fact that you guys really wanted to go a gradual approach. Like really build it out, get it out in the market, test it out and move on from there. As opposed to trying to go to a grand vision that will take years to achieve and potentially be late. As you said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Johan Pihl [21:59]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. You never know. <s>I mean,L <\/s>Like I said, this is an interesting market space because it&#8217;s not defined, everyone is eager to, highlight the potential, but we are definitely the ones that putting services out there first.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important to have a sense of clarity when working on projects together because it&#8217;s all about spirit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo [22:21]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. So for those who would like to know more about the 2030 calculator and about what you&#8217;re doing or potentially would want that a credit card that you offer, how could they sign up? How can they become a part of it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mathias <\/strong><strong>Wikstr\u00f6m<\/strong><strong> [22:33]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have on the website to begin with, you can connect with us out of a brand perspective. That is one way. Out of a media perspective if you would like to extend the reach of these opportunities and abilities, that&#8217;s another way. And of course, in regards to data contribution, and if there is other points of contact where we can collaborate, we&#8217;re super happy to do There is a lot of companies out there.&nbsp; A lot of good people on board that want, to drive positive change that wants to enable their consumers to understand their impact or want to use your dat, on behalf of others to make&nbsp; this calculator more granular.

Are they really who they say they are?<br>And obviously, if you&#8217;ve been in the financial services space, especially in the technology side of it, you&#8217;ve probably come across the terms, KYC, know your customer, AML, anti-money laundering, and of course, ID &amp; V, which is identity and verification. These things are extremely important, especially now in the age of remote work, remote connection. When we don&#8217;t necessarily get to see people live and we want to verify that they really are, who they say they are.<br>On this episode, I&#8217;m speaking to Peter Murray Of W2. Who provides the technology to power your identity and verification, KYC, and of course, AML needs. He talks about how the business model is changing, how people require a more international service than ever before and generally talks about some of the ways they&#8217;ve helped their customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I met Peter during a virtual FinTech conference called Pay360, organized by the Emerging Payments Association out of the UK. We were obviously supposed to both be there with our own booths in way back early in 2020, however, that did not happen. So I approached Peter digitally in his booth and just struck up a conversation.&nbsp; So Peter, can you give me a quick introduction of what is W2, who you are, and how you operate?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Peter Murray [01:53]&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, thanks for walking up to our booth, Marcel. No, thanks for the chance to introduce ourselves. My name&#8217;s Peter Murray. I head up sales here at W2, where a single platform, single APA provider for all your compliance and your customer intelligence needs. So if you imagine that customer journey from somebody coming on a website, from their first land on, from identifying the device ID through to the more familiar surroundings of AML, KYC and then on that end of the journey where it might be a fraud check, something like that. I think the things we might do differently from some of the names you might know out there is just pulling it all together in one spot. I think, drivers both in the payments and any heavily regulated sector, it&#8217;s about less suppliers, not more, more streamlined approach to it, the scalability and sustainability of your business.<br>So hopefully we find a fit within that. We&#8217;ve got client bases across heavily regulated markets, like payments financial services, the gambling sector. That&#8217;s what we do. We try to make compliance easy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo [02:58]<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how does a company start working with you? Is it about integrating an SDK or is there a deeper sort of connection into what they do? How does it work?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Peter Murray [03:05]&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think what happens, first of all, we had, we normally start talking about that customer journey, and that starts with someone, for example, it&#8217;s the normal stuff of all of the sales team, trying to get a deeper understanding of your business, because what we&#8217;re not is a product sales company.<br>The amount of services we provide are many, nobody generally takes just one of them. So it&#8217;s more of a conversation around your business and what you do, the challenges around that, how to differentiate your brand and obviously, maintain sustainability and profitability. So yeah, it&#8217;s a conversation with us.<br>We then bring in the various parts of the W2 team that can make that journey happen. So for example, if it is a simple compliance need, it&#8217;s the dev guys, it&#8217;s the onboarding team and it&#8217;s everybody else other than the sales guys who promise you the world, it&#8217;s everybody else who has to deliver it.<br>Thankfully, they&#8217;re all great. It\u2019s an initiative conversation. I think, it&#8217;s been interesting the last few months, because we&#8217;ve very much changed business format.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo [04:10]<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they decided to just remove friction and barriers from the process, because of course the world of charging money up front, putting a bunch of commitments in place &#8211; they know that world is over and they decided to move forward in a different way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Peter Murray [04:28]&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For us, it has to be about easing that journey. So not only, hopefully you got back product that we can deliver, but we&#8217;ve made the commercials a lot more attractive. And that&#8217;s why I think we sit well, fit well with fintechs and the payments.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo [04:42]&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is there any client of yours that you can publicly talk about that is currently using your technology and that people might already be using and just don&#8217;t know that it&#8217;s you behind it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Peter Murray [04:52]<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it depends what your marketplace, but as we&#8217;re at Pay360, If you look at, we announced the deal, which is probably good timing, which is company called Lanistar, they&#8217;re new to the disruption around sort of the payments sector and that&#8217;s we&#8217;ve had a lot of success in that over the years because it is around pulling all those systems together from a compliance point of view and then developing that into customer engagement. So that&#8217;s one today. Another one we announced today, a company called Verify, which we&#8217;re taking a new approach to using document and facial recognition, because I think a bit like banks, we are starting to realize that the differentiators aren&#8217;t in that old school credit-rating agency type of thing. It&#8217;s about, I think if you ever met our CEO, he is all about it&#8217;s the tech, not the check, he loves the cheese lines, but that was a business where we&#8217;re going.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo [05:51]&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as we all know, identity verification isn&#8217;t just about supporting the first country that you operate in, but it&#8217;s actually a global enterprise. It&#8217;s about understanding how your customers and their customers relate to a much more global audience and a global environment right now. So, this is why I asked Peter how W2 operates outside of the more traditional markets. ,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Peter Murray [06:17]&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are focused on where our customers are focused and one of the recurring themes coming out of the Pay360 event was where growth is going to come from.<br>And it&#8217;s seamless and cross border. I don&#8217;t know if anybody&#8217;s concentrated on one particular market. So just say that UK for the moment, then that&#8217;s automatically going to limit what you do. And so, for us, it&#8217;s about cross border trade and doing that seamlessly. Whether it&#8217;s the 160 countries, we can verify individuals in, or whether it&#8217;s just that journey from one country and then document and facial recognition, for us, it has to be about the global aspect of it. Just trying to rely on providing one level of support is not going to allow us as a business to grow, and it&#8217;s not going to allow our customers to grow. So for us, it&#8217;s all about that seamless customer global journey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo [07:13]&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What about company verification? You mentioned you can identify people, is company verification, also part of the suite?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Peter Murray [07:19]&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, I think one of the biggest changes we&#8217;ve seen over the last 6 to 12 months is all around KYB. Everybody knows, know your customer KYC. The fist money laundering directors are essentially around the ultimate beneficial owners.<br>The focus there is all around the business and that&#8217;s become front and center. So thankfully, we&#8217;ve just beefed up our offering and that, because it&#8217;s one of those things over the last couple of years that people thought was a nice to have. Now it&#8217;s becoming absolutely business critical. So for us, that&#8217;s a really important part of adding that into the offering.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo [07:57]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And since we were at Pay360, I asked Peter what are the big takeaways from that event. What did he learn and what did he hear was the big buzz in the payments and fintech industry<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Peter Murray <\/strong><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><strong>[08:08]&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Probably two things. I think if we look at what COVID has affected the industry, everybody means lockdown and that legitimizes FinTech. So people that might have been thinking about it and people that were possibly looking at it, even if the big banks have suddenly, but a headlong rush to this 72% increase in app user.<br>Five years growth in three months. So it&#8217;s this drive to legitimize FinTech if it&#8217;s needed. And the other thing about the similarities between other regulated markets, which is around sort of scalability and sustainability, seamless and cross border, and then speed and accuracy, things are just getting quicker.<br>And so ultimately the ones that are going to win in any of these markets are bulls that put customers at the heart of what they do. So whether it&#8217;s called hyper personalization, whatever, you truly have to understand your customer. I think the W2&#8217;s this, or we play our part in that, but it&#8217;s all around collaboration and pulling all that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo <\/strong><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><strong>[09:12]&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So now that you know more about W2&nbsp; this is the best way to reach Peter if you want to find out more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Peter Murray [09:18]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think we&#8217;re all on the usual LinkedIn and Twitter. And&nbsp; W2 global data.com website, but we do a lot on social media, so you can find us on any of them, either through the W2 site or me as Peter Murray as to just reach out to, through all the usual channels and what gets up just straight away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo [09:40]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would like to thank Peter for taking the time to talk to us about W2.

Just under a million? Over a billion? Well, as of right now, it&#8217;s probably somewhere in the range of 1.3 to 1.4 billion. But now to a more important question, as it says, this is a podcast about FinTech and financial services: How many of those people have a payment card?<br>It doesn&#8217;t matter whether it&#8217;s a debit card or credit card. How many of those have a payment card? Can you guess?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>On this episode of Inside the Vacuum, I speak with Jaijit, from ZUPCash, all the way from India. Usually, this podcast focuses on FinTech founders or people trying to make cool and interesting things in the financial services space. But this time, I&#8217;m talking about a topic that is absolutely mind-boggling to most Europeans and Americans, and that is the massive size of the Indian market or generally the Asian market right now.<br>There are massively growing economies. We recently had Brano from Vietnam, talking about how that market is very different from what we see in Europe. And today I have Jaijit, from ZUPCash, to tell us more about how they are changing the way small merchants accept payments in India. <br><br>So Jaijit, what does ZUPCash do, and how do you work?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jaijit Bhattacharya [01:36]&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We convert a smartphone into a payment acceptance system, and it&#8217;s able to accept payments from any digital tool.<br>So if it got with NFC or without NFC or with the phones with RFC or phones without an RFC. Or from a QR code-based payments, we enable our merchants to accept payments from any of these modes of payment that is out there. Therefore once the application is downloaded onto our merchant\u2019s phone, and the soft pass is there, there is no way that they will not be able to accept payment from the customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo [02:11]&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what this really means is that millions of merchants around India are now empowered to just download an app and start using it to accept payments. So the immediate question that comes up after that, is there even a market for it? Is there even POS terminal penetration that people just don&#8217;t need it yet.<br>Well, this is when I started to get really surprised by the scale at which things happen in India.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jaijit Bhattacharya [02:42]&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you look at China or even Brazil, they have got more than one payment terminal for every a hundred citizens.<br>We have got less than one for every 426 citizens. So that&#8217;s the difference that we have between China, Brazil, and India. And currently the payment terminal officially, the penetration of payment terminals is about 10% of the merchants. And officially it&#8217;s about 5% because there are a large number of people out there who are not typically merchants, but they need payment acceptance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo [03:09]&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So at this point, you must be thinking: this is people selling food on the street, this is small merchants selling things that they manufactured immediately in the marketplace somewhere. But that&#8217;s not really true. This goes all the way up in the food chain of merchants.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jaijit Bhattacharya [03:27]&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are doctors out there, they&#8217;re also merchants. There are ticketing agents, there are carpenters, there are electricians, there are taxi drivers. They&#8217;re all merchants. They all live to accept payments, but statistically, they&#8217;re not counted as merchants. So if you count all of them, as much as everybody who needs payment acceptance, then we have only about 5% penetration of payment dominance in India<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo [03:48]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You heard that correctly. There&#8217;s only 5% penetration of payment terminals in India. Does it mean that there&#8217;s just 5% of the population that have cards? Not really. And this is where the big surprise arrives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jaijit Bhattacharya [04:05]&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So fortunately because of the government intervention, the last four or five years, 360 million new accounts have been opened for those who never had a bank account. And so there are 360 million new debit cards up there. So there&#8217;s a total of 850 billion debit cards in India and about 50 million credit cards out there.<br>So there are 900 million owners, which means practically every adult in India has a card and therefore they can make a payment as long as there is a payment terminal on the other side.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo [04:37]&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So at this point, as a European, this starts to really make my brain go haywire. I mean 900 million owners of cards? That&#8217;s practically twice the size of the European market, depending on how you look at it, it&#8217;s possibly three times the size of the American market. This is just massive. Like, this is absolutely incredible having 900 million card owners and about 360 million of those being completely new in the market? That&#8217;s just massive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jaijit Bhattacharya [05:21]&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Absolutely, absolutely. We are extremely bullished. We believe we have the right place, right time. The government did most of the heavy lifting. They did the job of providing a bank account and a card to everybody in the country. We are just leveraging that and putting a layer of technology on top of it to take it to a logical conclusion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo [05:39]&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And at this point in their growth that really focusing on their core market which is using Android. They&#8217;re gonna support iOS eventually, but for now Android is the focus<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jaijit Bhattacharya [05:50]&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We haven&#8217;t gone ahead to support iPhone as of now, because the point is that we are really targeting those who are little lower in the pyramid of fortunes. And if somebody can afford an iPhone, they would rather buy a dedicated payment device while we are targeted towards those who are not in that income bracket.<br>And more importantly, even if there are chains and there are a lot of our customers who won&#8217;t change the shops. They will not go ahead and buy an iPhone for the employee so that they can do the billing and, hence logically from a business perspective, it makes sense for us to be sick to Android. Our lobbyists start getting requests from the doctors and architects and so on, who want to support iPhone because for them it&#8217;s fit for purpose.<br>You can&#8217;t expect to go to a doctor who then takes out a large POS machine from his pocket. In many of these circumstances, they can take out the phone and make a payment and they wouldn&#8217;t like to carry an Android phone and an iPhone.<br><br>We basically want to enable everybody else&#8217;s application to be able to have a payment system. So we would like to go deeper into all the industries and, and go deeper into the supply chain of payments or the value chain of payments.<br>And therefore we are providing a solution as a white label SDK, but you can get it plugged it into various kinds of other processes where at the end of the process, you have payments. You have payment reconciliation, and you are able to trace back and link it back to multiple other processes, which is why we&#8217;re providing a solution as a white table instigate.<br>It is embedded as part of a larger value chain of processes and systems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo [07:22]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So at this point, if you&#8217;re operating out of India, you&#8217;re now asking, how can I use this? How can I start working with this in my app or start using this as a merchant?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jaijit Bhattacharya [07:34]&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If they&#8217;re in India, they simply go to the Android store and download a ZUP POS and that&#8217;s it. It&#8217;s called ZUP POS&nbsp; and they simply download it and start using it.<br>We haven&#8217;t launched it in countries outside of India as of now, but we are handling all of those, on workstations from our Singapore office. We are registered in Singapore and, that&#8217;s where we are handling all the conversations outside of India. Because we need to make sure that it&#8217;s aligned to the payment regulatory regulations in each of the countries.<br>And hence we are, right now live in India, but we will be launching in other countries, perhaps in partnerships. In fact, we are looking forward to partnerships in other countries where the payment aggregator work is done by a partner and we provide the technical.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo [08:20]&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can find all the links in the description so feel free to click there and go directly to either sign up or find out more and if you want to reach Jaijit directly here&#8217;s his email address.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jaijit Bhattacharya &nbsp;[08:32]&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My email address is jbh@zedup.cash, which is cash.

But today, we actually don&#8217;t really carry that much cash around, we prefer to pay with our phones. We just tap our phones, we hear the nice beep, and off we go.<br>However, there are situations where people cannot or do not want to carry around their card on their phone and don&#8217;t want to carry around cash. So what&#8217;s the obvious solution? The good old fashioned payment card. But what if you don&#8217;t want to touch the pin pad, especially in the times of Coronavirus, or if you just want to make the whole thing more secure, but at the same time, not have to touch anything while you are paying.<br>There&#8217;s a solution for that. It&#8217;s called a biometric payment card and it&#8217;s one of the things I&#8217;m going to be talking to Angela Davis, the head of sales for Thames Technology today. In this episode, I&#8217;m not speaking to a founder of a FinTech, I&#8217;m not going to be talking about the software powering fintechs and modern banks. I&#8217;m going to be talking about the hardware. I&#8217;m going to be talking about the cards.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>So let&#8217;s go straight to Angela. What is Thames Technology, what do you do and what makes you unique?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Angela Davies [1:52]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are a manufacturer and we manufacture cards. We are also present within the kind of gift card market as well in a retail environment.<br>But within obviously the scope we manufacture payment cards certified with Visa, MasterCard soon to be certified with UnionPay, and yes, we actually do the manufacturer all the way through to the personalization. So we have one site in the UK, which is quite unique actually, because most manufacturers, they have multiple sites with manufacturing in one country, personalization in another country.<br>We do everything in one location. So we have the manufacturer of the cards and then they go through into our Bureau where we personalize the cards. I&#8217;m on a call off basis for our clients. And they&#8217;re dispatched directly on the home, mostly directly to the end user. So when you receive your new prepaid card or your credit card or debit card, it would be coming from a manufacturer just as, like Thames.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo [02:16]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wonderful. So what makes you unique out of all the manufacturers? Of course there&#8217;s a lot around the world, many people might know one of them just because they manufactured their own card, but what makes you unique? What makes you different in the market?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Angela Davies [02:30]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We tend to work mostly in the challenger bank kind of FinTech space, mostly because we have not necessarily always been involved in banking.<br>So we&#8217;ve entered the banking world, we were certified in 2003, which actually is quite recent compared to any of our competitors. And also our kind of lead times do actually in our development and lead times do tend to suit that particular space. So we&#8217;re quite quick to deliver cards. I&#8217;ve seen again, having it all in one space, we can have cards out within a matter of weeks, into our personalization Bureau and out the door<br>So actually we tend to be a better place in that kind of FinTech environment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo [03:08]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when people hear personalization, they think down to the person. Is this personalizing them all the way to the name of the person?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Angela Davies [03:16]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So obviously depending on the scheme that will other programs that we&#8217;re working on, and we do some clients who will be actually company driven. But no, there would be personalization to the actual individuals.<br>Our data center, they would be receiving files from the processes, that like serve GPS, for example. And first data, those guys will actually be sending us data on a daily basis. Naturally we have to be very secure as a site. So there&#8217;s a lot of regulations that we have to follow as a site. And we have to go through annual audits with the schemes and with PCI to remain compliant.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo [03:50]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay cool. So what happens after you receive the data?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Angela Davies [03:54]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We receive the data and then we actually, we\u2019d be picking the cards from the secure vault that have already been produced as a base card. And then they go through our machines personalized into a pack. That might be a quite bespoke slider type pack with a little box or could just be straight onto the carrier into an envelope and then they join the postal system.<br>And you can view up ultimately. So it&#8217;s fair to say that the majority of the cards would go into the UK postal system therefore UK customers. But actually we do a lot that goes out all the way across Europe. And we tend to find that, yes, okay, it takes two or three days to actually arrive with the customer through the postal, but if we&#8217;re fulfilling the card within one-two days, and then we&#8217;re still providing a very good service for that and for that cost.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo [04:42]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Great. So looking at this from the perspective of somebody who would like to manufacture cards to issue to their end consumers, would they be working directly with you as a fintech or would they be working with an issuer who is already working with you?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Angela Davies [04:59]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We work with a number of the kind of higher profile fintechs, but we also work with actually issuers who might manage the card programs for their clients.<br>And so the actual brand is not necessarily who our client is. They might actually be the issuers. And do a lot of that work where we are managing lots and lots of different card programs for one particular issuer.<br>And in some respect as well, we kind of also manage a full retail pack. So that&#8217;s become more and more popular recently where it&#8217;s secure, we actually refer to it as our ultra secure pack and we can actually package up a Visa, MasterCard, prepaid card, non-personalized, or non personalized to an individual, and secure it into a retail pack, which is then sold within the high street, for example. And so that&#8217;s another option that&#8217;s available with Thames.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo [05:50]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we met at Pay360. This is actually where we&#8217;re recording this interview. This is an EPA, Emerging Payments Association event that unfortunately this year had to be virtual. However, we still got to attend a virtual round table where we spoke about the future of payment cards and where they&#8217;re going to be heading.<br>One of the things you brought up, which is actually one of your products, which really picked my interest because I&#8217;m just really interested in cool new technology in this space, is biometric payment cards. I&#8217;m just really fascinated by the fact that you can now actually have payment cards that have biometric readers in them so that you can actually authenticate people, as they&#8217;re paying on the actual card. So let&#8217;s talk a little bit more about that.<br>How is it different from regular contactless or what people might be used to already?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Angela Davies [06:41]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contactless, as you can imagine, has brought in an element of risk. We know that we&#8217;re not going through a two factor authentication when we&#8217;re using our contactless card. There\u2019s no pin to add or a fingerprint that you might have on your phone.<br>So in contactless mode, we do have a cap and that cap has been raised doing lockdown to 20- 45 pounds within the UK. And to help try and I guess encourage the use of contactless, it&#8217;s a non-touch option for customers. They don&#8217;t have to touch a device that somebody else may have touched. And this is not a new product, the biometric payment card, but it&#8217;s been piloted has been encouraged through the schemes for quite a while now, but we do feel like this is probably the time that this will actually grow and will become much more prominent.<br>The payment card basically includes a fingerprint sensor into the actual card. So as opposed to having a card with a chip only you have a card with the chip and the fingerprint sensor. And the fingerprint sensor enables you to authenticate your transaction. So actually, instead of using a pin, you can use a fingerprint just as you do with your mobile phone to authenticate your usage of that phone or various different apps and use your fingerprint to actually power of the card.<br>It means that actually for a contactless transaction you don&#8217;t need to set a limit and the schemes are very much in favor of that, moving that limit for the contactless transactions. Because you&#8217;ve got your fingerprint is your authentication. And we all know that fingerprint s generally, the biometric detail around that is more secure than say a pin would be, as it isn\u2019t something that you have, it\u2019s that you are.<br>So that&#8217;s the premise behind the actual product. It means that you conduct and then you transact contactlessly for a large sum of money, and you don&#8217;t need to be concerned about having to touch the pin. There is a lot of security around that as well, so the chip is actually the method of holding your fingerprint as such, we know it&#8217;s not actually a fingerprint. It&#8217;s almost a kind of a model of your fingerprint, so it&#8217;s actually held on the chip as opposed to being held in a database somewhere as well. So it&#8217;s very much a secure method of actually authenticating the user of the card.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo [08:54]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wow. That&#8217;s wild. That sounds like some sort of sci-fi future where you&#8217;re pulling out that card and you&#8217;re authenticating yourself with a fingerprint. It seems very futuristic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Angela Davies [09:06]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Years ago we probably would have been seeing that back, but I suppose in a way, one of the reasons, and not just from a cope perspective, but one of the reasons that actually biometrics is sortable more acceptable nowadays, is actually because the likes of Apple and the likes of the mobile phone industry have really allowed us all to embrace biometric tech without feeling necessarily vulnerable in that field necessarily in any fear of our details. So we know it&#8217;s held locally, we know it\u2019s held within our device as such, and I think as well, that would help the adoption of biometrics within general society.<br>And there was a lot of fear around biometric safety 5 to 10 years ago, but I think, I do feel as if there\u2019s change, the tide is turned on that particular point, Again, mentioned earlier about the hygiene, concerns, within the environment, within the society now of&nbsp; having to touch multi-use devices. I certainly don&#8217;t want to be using my pin at the moment where I can, in any way, avoid it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo [10:06]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah and I guess, fintechs and banks or issuers out there would really like having this in their portfolio because it really showcases that they care about what&#8217;s happening out there in the world and they want to keep people safe and secure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Angela Davies [10:19]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So from the issuer or the bank&#8217;s perspective, it makes absolute sense to go down this route. And to ensure actually that their cards, the ones that are picked out of people&#8217;s wallets, you could imagine, nobody walks around with one card anymore, or one account. We all have multiple.<br>And I wanted some, as soon as you open up that wallet, you&#8217;re making a choice. You&#8217;re making the choice of which card you use. So actually having that choice as being a hygiene or security choice, as opposed to, oh, that&#8217;s just a nice card design, or potentially that this is the account I want to use.<br>It&#8217;s actually a physical, it&#8217;s a much more kind of motive decision at that point. So I think there&#8217;s a definite argument that this will be the route that a lot of banks will take. Not necessarily straight away. They&#8217;ll no doubt want to go through pilots, but certainly in the next, I would say 12 to 24 months, they&#8217;ll see a real turn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo [11:09]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, absolutely. And especially now in these high hygiene considerations that we have right now, it is something that is going to gain more interest from people out there. So Angela, I would like to thank you so much for taking the time today. There&#8217;s probably lots of questions that people have about Thames Technology, the types of cards you offer, the ways you can set them up and especially these nice biometric cards that we talked about today. So if somebody wants to find out more, how can they reach you? How can they reach the company?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Angela Davies [11:40]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Go to our website <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thamestechnology.co.uk\/\">https:\/\/www.thamestechnology.co.uk\/<\/a>, and that gives you a contact us, or that would be absolutely fine, or find us on LinkedIn. So that&#8217;s, they&#8217;re probably the easiest methods. We&#8217;d love to help. That&#8217;s the thing, actually, we tend to work with startups.<br>So we&#8217;re quite used to that scenario of somebody completely new into the market. Just find their issue, or just talk to your processor and need to start thinking about how you go about issuing cards and our technical team can pull upon to hold and manage through that process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marcel Klimo [12:11]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wonderful. Thank you Angela for your time.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And to all the listeners. Thank you for listening. When I met Angela at Pay360 last month, I just needed to take some of her time to tell you more about biometric cards. We had a very interesting conversation and I wanted to tell you about what it is, how it works, and maybe this is something that you might want to use in your own business, in your own FinTech, in your own startup.<br>So if you enjoyed this episode and you want to hear more, you can definitely subscribe to more of these episodes where I talk to founders, to technology providers, to vendors from the fintech, payments banking industry.<br>If you have any recommendations for more guests, please let me know. Please subscribe on all major podcasting platforms and hopefully we get to talk sometime online soon.<br><br>This has been Inside the Vacuum. And my name is Marcel Klimo.&nbsp; Take care.

A small hint; it isn\u2019t the ginormous rigid and extremely expensive mainframes, it isn\u2019t the systems that have to shut down every night for maintenance, and it definitely isn\u2019t the glued-by-hope hollowed out cores.<br><br>The list can go on and on. What a good 21st century bank needs is security, scalability, flexibility, availability, and adaptability. So, where do you get it all, nicely packed and with a bow on top at a low cost?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The answer is \u201cmicroservices\u201d.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s the same as choosing Netflix or other streaming services to watch your favorite shows and movies (emphasis on the <strong>favorite<\/strong>) instead of paying expensive TV packages with 525,600 channels no one is ever going to watch. Why pay more for a user-unfriendly experience?<br><br>The Netflix of banking is called a cloud-native core engine. Or, to be more precise, cloud-native is a streaming service. Netflix would be <strong>the Vault by Thought Machine<\/strong>.<br><br>What makes Vault different is that it combines all the requirements of a successful digital bank. The data is encrypted in such a way not even Jedi would stand a chance, the security is very high with this one. It can efficiently run a bank of any size. And it can handle the transactions faster than Flash can run. You pay only for the exact amount of hardware it uses, no extra costs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1709\" src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/cinema-movie-streaming-PK5ATCH-scaled-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2747\" srcset=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/cinema-movie-streaming-PK5ATCH-scaled-1.jpg 2560w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/cinema-movie-streaming-PK5ATCH-scaled-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/cinema-movie-streaming-PK5ATCH-scaled-1-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/cinema-movie-streaming-PK5ATCH-scaled-1-768x513.jpg 768w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/cinema-movie-streaming-PK5ATCH-scaled-1-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/cinema-movie-streaming-PK5ATCH-scaled-1-2048x1367.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And since we are now living in a digital and remote world, this means the death of the 9-5 mindset of many banks, which open in the morning and close in the evening. Customers want access to their money all the time. The Vault is always available, designed for the 24\/7\/365 world of the 21s century.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The core banking engine Vault has been written purposefully as a cloud-native by Thought Machine from its inception. Vault is built around APIs using a microservices architecture. The services within Vault constitute a significant portion of all the functionality required to run a bank. For example, they are currently powering Asia&#8217;s first all-in-one numberless bank card and virtual bank Mox by Standard Chartered, and banks like Lloyds Banking Group, Atom Bank, or SEB.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vault\u2019s Configuration Layer enables a bank to achieve a wide scale of customization without changing anything in the underlying platform. It is&nbsp; highly advantageous and key part of how Vault\u2019s architecture is a counterweight to the \u201cspaghetti\u201d that arises in other systems when customization and platform functionality are not separated<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need to change something or launch a new product, Vault\u2019s architecture allows it with minimal disruption. Upgrades can happen with zero downtime and a much simpler rollback if any issues arise. Need a specific functionality? No problem, Vault is more flexible than a ballet dancer at her prime and implements new services in a very short time. And if something goes wrong, Chuck Norris wishes he could fix it as easily as Vault.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Got it? Now go and build your own 21st century digital bank, you have the gift of knowledge. Actually, no. Run. Fly, you fools! Before your competition seizes their opportunity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/inside.vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/technology-VY3DB6C-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2734\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h1>Do you need a guide?<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the point where we would normally part ways.

The old model was already rickety and barely surviving &#8212; legacy players have played it safe: applying piecemeal digital band-aids at the boundaries of antique legacy infrastructure, rather than building new architecture from the ground up.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Between the vaporware decks, the innovation theatre, bloated valuations, and rapidly failing business models, and vendors chosen by a cost vs. value driven procurement department, the consumers we portend to serve are left out in the cold.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You all know exactly what I am talking about.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any of us that have spent even one quarter working in or with a bank or insurer understand well the ghostly specters of badly-chosen vendors. Bright innovative minds wasting their youths on patching up old core systems, and the unavoidable fines and scandals when process or security are breached.&nbsp; As I said, it is rickety and we need more than a fresh paint job on the Winchester Mystery House.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a storm, rickety becomes dangerous, and this is one hell of a storm.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/inside.vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/business-strategy-and-orientation-concept-K3TXKE9-1024x633.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2715\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So, now for the 50,000-foot view, I promised.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are eight ideas for exploration and debate as we weather this (seemingly unending) storm:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Shut down the performative innovation.<\/strong> This is something that so many corporates are guilty of promulgating. All of the CVCs, accelerators, pitching competitions or hackathons on the planet will not cure what ails you. It\u2019s not helping.<\/li><li><strong>Accept that getting out of technological debt requires investing.<\/strong> And the best time to invest is in a downturn. It\u2019s going to cost time, money, and political will to make real change.\u00a0 Get your check book out.<\/li><li><strong>Repeat after me: \u201cThe future is further out than one quarter.\u201d <\/strong>We have a real short-term perception issue. It may take years to see the benefits of what you are building.\u00a0 Focus on future value and don\u2019t be fooled by short term KPIs. Lead.<\/li><li><strong>Manage the hell out of your stakeholders.<\/strong> You\u2019re going to need them. Find wins for everyone involved and don\u2019t forget the greatest beneficiaries should be (in this order, because, get real): your current customers, your future customers and your investors.\u00a0 Challenge yourself and pick your friends wisely.<\/li><li><strong>When you work with startups &#8212; and you should continue to do this come hell or high water &#8212; go deeper.<\/strong>\u00a0 Work closely with their investors to make sure that they\u2019re built for the long-haul, especially if you want them to be close to your core technology.\u00a0 Get under the hood and stay there.<\/li><li><strong>Align yourself with savvy investors.<\/strong> I don\u2019t mean doing exactly what the Silicon Valley \u201cset\u201d is doing, I mean working with investors that understand your industry deeply and have already survived their technology curve. Learn the intrinsic differences between VC and PE, equity or debt, and, when in doubt, learn the lessons taught to us by complex later-stage financing.\u00a0 Do the maths.<\/li><li><strong>Cling closely to the experts.<\/strong> This is a time for expertise across the board. The financial services industry is laden with danger. Traditional \u201cdisruption\u201d does not work when you\u2019re playing at this level, and that\u2019s a good thing.\u00a0 Love your nerds.<\/li><li><strong>Think infrastructure and architecture, not single-feature products<\/strong>. Creating Fintech products and services is fiendishly complex with multi-dimensional challenges, and each product or service should not have to build out the entire stack from scratch. We need standardized building blocks and infrastructure and less recreation of wheels. The legacy players should shift to provide the infrastructure upon which the nimble new players innovate.\u00a0 Get your \u201clego\u201d blocks ready.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A brilliant former colleague of mine adapted the often-used adage of \u201ceating your own dog food\u201d to something more palatable: \u201cdrinking your own champagne\u201d. At Vacuumlabs we\u2019ve been drinking our own champagne by shaping our consortia as we approach existing and new clients.&nbsp; The other firms I work with have similarly hunkered down, made tough decisions, and are choosing their friends and vendors very carefully.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Storms have a way of exposing a reality we may have preferred not to look at. We are in the midst of a storm and for the fintech space, the truth, and it\u2019s consequences are no longer avoidable.&nbsp; Reach out to help sort through the noise any time, together we can keep our eyes and hearts on that signal.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This is the time that will define the thinkers, movers, and shakers who will shape the rest of this century.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":17,"featured_media":2716,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":""},"categories":[14,13],"tags":[32,178,43,179,120,34,180,85,181,70,182,78,60,183,62,37],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v16.4 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Truth or Consequences: Finding Signal in the Age of Covid - Vacuumlabs<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Financial services and technology are going through big shifts.

With almost 1.4 billion Indian citizens, can you guess the number of card holders? The number has recently rose thanks to the government intervention in the last few years. For people that didn\u2019t own a bank account before, around 360 million new accounts were created. Altogether, there are around 850 million debit card holders and 50 million credit card holders in India.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&nbsp;&#8216;So there are 900 million card owners, which means practically every adult in India has a card and therefore they can make a payment as long as there is a payment terminal on the other side.&#8217; &#8211; Jajit Bhattacharya<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>And this is where the issue arises. Even though the number of merchants is incredibly high in India, the penetration of payment terminals is only 5%. Hard to believe. Why is that? Because small merchants such as taxi drivers or doctors, who also need to accept card payments as it\u2019s crucial for their business, are not officially counted as merchants.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/0p6iPxHxn-hYU5xriWM8A3GxSA0uvZ3IRwcPWXdEqIZljmBTCWCRV8XNdyDSTj5X4z1qo4nZXdXpgLtpgfIByoroRBkwlFOYNktUraoiyjHjVqTzwmDuNNVhrTzWQwTKbb_Moo_L\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>So how do they cope with such a high number of payment cards and low number of terminals?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quite a challenging situation for fintechs, right? This is where Zerone Microsystems comes to the scene and takes advantage of the fact that these days nearly everyone owns a smartphone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They developed an application that enables everyone who install it to accept payments.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8216;We convert a smartphone into a payment acceptance POS, and it&#8217;s able to accept payments from any digital phone.&#8217; &#8211; Jajit Bhattacharya<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This way, every small merchant, taxi driver, carpenter or fruit seller, can accept payments and run their business.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Android over iOS<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, the focus of Zerone Microsystems is on Android as this operating system has the biggest market share. The expansion to more platforms is already planned since&nbsp; iOS application usage was requested by the market. So far, the application is usable only in India, but according to Jaijit, they are working on extending their business to Singapore. They also keep looking for other business opportunities. As every country has its own regulations, the company realizes that partnerships might be the right step to take.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8216;In fact, we are looking forward to partnerships in other countries where the payment aggregator work is done by a partner and we provide the technical.&#8217; &#8211; Jajit Bhattacharya<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you enjoyed this episode and want to hear more interesting stories of founders, technology providers, or vendors from the fintech, payments, and banking industry, don\u2019t forget to subscribe to Inside the Vacuum on one of the major podcasting platforms.

They can basically include a fingerprint sensor into the actual card. The model of the fingerprint is held on the physical card on a chip, instead of in a database.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The solution has been piloted for a while now, but with the spread of coronavirus, this is probably the time for it to become much more prominent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>\u2018I&#8217;m just really fascinated by the fact that you can now have payment cards that have biometric readers in them, so you can actually authenticate people as they&#8217;re paying.\u2019<\/em> &#8211; Marcel Klimo<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3>Risk reduction<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The biometric authentication has a competitive advantage on the market of non-touch payment options.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>\u2018Contactless, as you can imagine, has brought in an element of risk. We know that we&#8217;re not going through a two-factor authentication when we&#8217;re using our contactless card. There\u2019s no pin to add or a fingerprint that you might have on your phone.\u2019 <\/em>&#8211; Angela Davies<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The contactless payment limit has been increased in the UK from \u00a330 to \u00a345, to help stop coronavirus spreading. As opposed to traditional payment cards, <strong>with a biometric payment card you don&#8217;t need to set a limit for a contactless transaction.<\/strong> It is a secure way of authenticating the user of the card, even more secure than using a pin, therefore the schemes are very much in favor of this innovation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Innovation adoption<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>\u2018That sounds like some sort of sci-fi future where you&#8217;re pulling out that card and you&#8217;re authenticating yourself with a fingerprint.

Learn about how they approached open banking a bit differently, giving it some Australian flavour.<br><br>Dom started his career as a software developer. For 25 years he has been operating in the software industry and for the last decade in the Fintech world, working on different projects in the US, the UK, and Australia. Although his initiatives turned out differently, the foundation was always the same: wanting to disrupt, to innovate, and to think outside the box. His vision has always been <strong>using a confluence of design, technology, and financial services together and turning it into something interesting<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pioneers in neobanking<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A few years back, Dom and his company <a href=\"https:\/\/ferocia.com.au\/\">Ferocia<\/a> were looking for options to raise capital, therefore, they were talking with the managing director of<strong> <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bendigoadelaide.com.au\/\"><strong>Bendigo and Adelaide Bank<\/strong><\/a><strong> which is the fifth-largest bank in Australia. <\/strong>At that time, Bendigo wanted to build their internet banking system. Dom\u2019s team took the opportunity and built a prototype that turned into a platform that has 1.8 million customers by now.<br><br>By launching their mobile system, they developed a trust relationship with Bendigo, so when<strong> Ferocia decided to build the first challenger bank in Australia<\/strong>, Bendigo was very supportive.<br><br>There are 3 essential ingredients of launching a bank: <strong>having a banking license, reserve capital, and a core banking system<\/strong>. As Dom explained, at that time, restricted banking licenses didn\u2019t exist in Australia. The capital market also needed to mature to raise the sort of capital you need for building a bank.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>\u2018In the discussions with Bendigo, we landed on this idea that they already have a banking license as the 5th largest bank in the country and they run about 10 different brands within their group. Could we launch another bank using their banking license? That has never been done before. And so we had spent maybe a year or so with the regulators working out how we could do that.\u2019<\/em> &#8211; Dom Pym<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Long story short, <strong>they launched in 2018 with the first digital bank to market in Australia: Up Bank<\/strong>.<br><br><strong>Just right after, restricted APIs were introduced in the country, in parallel with the open banking movement overseas.<\/strong> Australia became a vibrant scene of fintech actions, big international fintechs like PayPal, Stripe, Square, and TransferWise opened up their operation in Australia, also local players appeared on the market.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"630\" src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Up_Card_and_phone.jpg\" alt=\"Challenger Bank Up\" class=\"wp-image-2662\" srcset=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Up_Card_and_phone.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Up_Card_and_phone-300x158.jpg 300w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Up_Card_and_phone-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Up_Card_and_phone-768x403.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><figcaption>Up Bank<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Protecting the customers<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The fintech scene in Europe and Asia has influenced the thought process and the decision making in Australia too. But the actual legislation that has been passed is far beyond open banking in other countries. <strong>Customer Data Rights (CDR) puts the consumer back in control of their own data<\/strong>, empowering end-users instead of third parties.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>\u2018I think over the next 10 years we&#8217;re going to see this legislative change, not just in financial services, but across all of the markets and all the industries in Australia, and banking was chosen as the first industry to adopt it.<\/em> <em>I would say that our open banking is inspired by what&#8217;s happened overseas, but is actually a subset of this new legislation around consumer data rights.\u2019<\/em> &#8211; Dom Pym<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Up is a supporter of the open banking movement and they have <strong>recently launched their own API<\/strong> <strong>which had a thousand donor recipients within a week<\/strong>. The fact that Up put the customer in control of their data rather than the third party data recipients, resulted in some <strong>cool apps built on top of the Up API by the users<\/strong>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Spotify playlist monetizer &#8211; you can vote for your favorite song with your money, and then the highest bid moves it up on the playlist<\/li><li>Someone integrated the Up API into their home automation system &#8211; made their lights change color and flash and their sprinkler system turn on when they paid money<\/li><li>Another person built an automated system that donated to charities<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More interesting outcomes than another price comparison tool or insurance calculator, right?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How is Up\u2019s approach different?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Banks are trying to comply, and they have a more traditional approach with big project teams, waterfall models, fixed budgets and timelines. Up on the other hand is <strong>technology led by banking <\/strong>rather than banking led by technology.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>Whereas we&#8217;re coming at it from, how do we improve the customer experience? How do we help innovation? How do we improve competition? How do we win new customers\u2019 hearts and minds? And we&#8217;re doing all of that with technology. Ferocia is an organization of engineers. We don&#8217;t have a single banker working for Up. We have a partnership with Bendigo, while everybody in the company is a software engineer, a product person, or directly assisting the customer.\u2019<\/em> &#8211; Dom Pym<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Up has a very small team, but over 250,000 customers. As they scale, they are looking for possibilities to solve the emerging issues by technology. They are doing <strong>a thousand or more deployments a year to production<\/strong>, while a traditional bank might do just a few yearly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8216;<em>To launch new features after new features, it&#8217;s just more like a Facebook or a Twitter or an Instagram or a Square or a Stripe, and a lot less like a bank.\u2019 <\/em>&#8211; Dom Pym<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Up has a<strong> partnering approach<\/strong> rather than trying to solve every problem itself. It was the <strong>first cloud-hosted retail bank in Australia<\/strong> and the first cloud-hosted bank on Google in the world. It was also the first bank in Australia to offer instant issuance for ApplePay wallet, GooglePay, SamsungPay, and the first one in the country to integrate with AfterPay and with TransferWise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>\u2018We used that engineering mindset, that technology-led drive and that different way of solving problems to literally be the first to do things.\u2019 <\/em>&#8211; Dom Pym<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/TW_UP_2.png\" alt=\"Challenger Bank Up\" class=\"wp-image-2664\" srcset=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/TW_UP_2.png 1920w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/TW_UP_2-300x169.png 300w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/TW_UP_2-1024x576.png 1024w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/TW_UP_2-768x432.png 768w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/TW_UP_2-1536x864.png 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" \/><figcaption>Up Bank and TransferWise<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>The big vision of Up<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On the Asian market, super apps like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wechat.com\/en\/\">WeChat<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.grab.com\/sg\/\">Grab<\/a> are dominating, which include basically your whole life: ordering pizza, a taxi, handling your payments, or booking a doctor\u2019s appointment online.<br><br>On the other hand, Up\u2019s core focus is <strong>trying to help people spend wisely and save effortlessly<\/strong>. It is helping people reconnect with their money and take control of their finances. It is the first bank in Australia to introduce automation in terms of predicting your future spending.<br><br>This may be the reason for having an <strong>extraordinarily high level of engagement with their customer base, the upsiders<\/strong>. Up is the highest-rated banking app in Australia in both the AppStore and GooglePlay with thousands of customer reviews.<br>It is considered an honest and transparent brand, talking about things that are already live on the market. As a result,<strong> upsiders make Up their primary financial institution, interacting with the app outstandingly a lot<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>[cta_to_website]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hot topic: design thinking<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Number of clicks<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>On Up\u2019s platform the average time to sign up a bank account is 2 minutes and 12 seconds. In Dom\u2019s opinion, it wouldn&#8217;t even matter if it was 12 minutes. <strong>Clicks can be reduced by putting them on one screen but that just leads to a horrible experience.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>\u2018All around the world at the moment, there&#8217;s all this talk about how many clicks does it take to make a payment, or how many clicks does it take to sign up? We don&#8217;t give a shit how many it takes. We actually take a contrary view: how does it feel? When you sign up for Up, does it feel easy or does it feel hard? If you got twenty clicks or a hundred clicks, it doesn&#8217;t matter. We use an atomic method for form engagement with our customers, which means we only ask for one thing on a screen.\u2019<\/em> &#8211; Dom Pym<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3>Building blocks<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>minimum viable product approach<\/strong> that Up has is not common in banking. Up had the basic app and built features on top of what it launched with at the beginning. The half a dozen deployments it does a day allow it to respond quickly to customer needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>\u2018We iterate and improve at such a rapid pace that it doesn&#8217;t matter if we don&#8217;t have something today because we&#8217;ll have it tomorrow.\u2019 <\/em>&#8211; Dom Pym<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tree of Up<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Up has a <strong>special roadmap called the <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/up.com.au\/tree\/\"><strong>Tree of Up<\/strong><\/a><strong> visualizing the logic behind<\/strong> how developers are building the bank, basically the way they are thinking.

Each of these three (and a half\u2026) eras saw a distinct level of differentiation in the market that led to changes in the way consumers interacted with their money. Let\u2019s take a look at these eras:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Fintech 1.0 (1886 &#8211; 1967)<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This stage involves <strong>building the infrastructure that will support globalized financial services<\/strong>. The first transatlantic cable (1866) and Fedwire (1918) in the USA enabled the first electronic fund transfer system using technologies such as telegraph and Morse code. It was basic by today\u2019s standards, but at a time of developing infrastructure and transportation, the ability to make financial transactions over a more considerable distance was revolutionary.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Fintech 2.0 (1967 &#8211; 2008)<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The start of this phase is marked by the installation of the first ATM by Barclays in 1967, and is characterised by the <strong>switch from analogue to the digitalization of finances<\/strong>. The 1970s saw the establishment of NASDAQ, the world\u2019s first digital stock exchange and SWIFT (Society For Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications), a communication protocol between financial institutions facilitating the large volume of cross-border payments.<br><br>This era continued through the 1980s with the rise of bank mainframe computers (and a \u201cGordon Gecko\u201d sense of Wall Street style\u2026) and the growth of online banking through the 1980s saw the way people do business change, with the <strong>online revolution<\/strong> leading to a shift in how people perceived financial institutions.<br><br>The 1990s saw the <strong>first movements towards digital banking<\/strong>, with connected customers starting to manage their money in different ways. PayPal was launched in 1998 which would hint towards the new payment systems that would come as the world increasingly went online.<br>Everything in the economy looked good and it even prompted the then UK Chancellor Gordon Brown to declare the \u201cend of boom and bust\u201d. However, it was this particular bust &#8211; the global financial crisis of 2008, that brought down the curtain on this era of fintech and prompted the innovation that would be seen during the following era.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Fintech 3.0 (2008-Current)<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Post-financial crisis, lack of trust in banks aligned with <strong>regulatory change opens up the market to new providers<\/strong>. Bitcoin is born in 2009 followed by other cryptocurrencies using blockchain technology.&nbsp;<br><br>Smartphone adoption means that <strong>mobile devices become the primary means<\/strong> by which people access the web and other financial services.<br><br>It\u2019s become the <strong>era of the start-up<\/strong>, with an appetite for innovation amongst investors and consumers driving a wave of new products and services. Even established banks are starting to act and brand themselves like start-ups and this move away from the established banks of the Fintech 2.0 era has been the defining element of Fintech 3.0.<br><br>To support this, <strong>new technologies have opened-up to make it easier to create digital banking products using Open Banking, that allows third-party companies access to financial data<\/strong>.<br><br>Banking as a Service (BaaS) platforms including Treezor and SolarisBank have made it easier for banks and other financial institutions to get away from complicated legacy systems to enable them to launch \u201cneo-banks\u201d &#8211; digital banks that have emerged based around improving the customer experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1100\" src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/andrej-lisakov-XL-hPDNeZvs-unsplash-scaled-e1599124472241.jpg\" alt=\"Fintech\" class=\"wp-image-2647\" srcset=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/andrej-lisakov-XL-hPDNeZvs-unsplash-scaled-e1599124472241.jpg 2560w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/andrej-lisakov-XL-hPDNeZvs-unsplash-scaled-e1599124472241-300x129.jpg 300w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/andrej-lisakov-XL-hPDNeZvs-unsplash-scaled-e1599124472241-1024x440.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/andrej-lisakov-XL-hPDNeZvs-unsplash-scaled-e1599124472241-768x330.jpg 768w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/andrej-lisakov-XL-hPDNeZvs-unsplash-scaled-e1599124472241-1536x660.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/andrej-lisakov-XL-hPDNeZvs-unsplash-scaled-e1599124472241-2048x880.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Fintech 3.5<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in the Fintech 1.0 era in 1886, someone threw a cable under the Atlantic and this kick-started the way that banks do business for the next century. The previous fintech eras haven\u2019t moved much further geographically than that wire under the ocean, with the vast majority of development taking place across the developed world &#8211; mainly Europe and the USA.<br><br>Fintech 3.5 has been defined to account for the changes in consumer behaviour and how they access the internet in the developing world. The two countries with the highest fintech usage are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ey.com\/Publication\/vwLUAssets\/ey-fintech-adoption-index-2017\/$FILE\/ey-fintech-adoption-index-2017.pdf\">China and India<\/a>, which are about as far from this cable as you can get. These countries haven\u2019t been burdened with the physical banking infrastructure of those in the west, and so have been able to adopt new solutions more quickly than their Western counterparts.<br><br><strong>Fintech 3.5 signals a move away from the western dominated financial world and acknowledges the advances that are being made in digital banking around the world.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Future<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With the world currently recovering from a major pandemic, looking into a crystal ball and predicting the future is a little difficult. As of May 2020, Venture Capital fintech investment <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fintechmagazine.com\/fintech\/fintech-investment-drops-due-covid-19\">dropped $6.1bn<\/a>, the lowest for funding since the first quarter of 2019.<br><br>However, <strong>the underlying technology that has driven the Fintech 3.5\/3.5 era, namely blockchain and open banking, will continue to drive the innovation of the future<\/strong>.<br><br><strong>Machine Learning<\/strong> is set to evolve the way we interact with banks and insurance companies, designed to strengthen the customer relationship by developing a \u201csegment of one\u201d By doing this, financial institutions can target individuals with bespoke offers and support that match their behaviour and will create a more relevant experience for them.<br><br>German digital bank N26 is already <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/15a5126e-b907-11e9-8a88-aa6628ac896c\">creating custom offers<\/a> such as discounts with flexible workspace WeWork and online travel booking site GetYourGuide, while their rival Revolut is developing a machine learning product to help customers budget based on their last 3-6 months of spending.<br><br>This innovation isn\u2019t just restricted to the banking sector. Insurance companies are set to turn to machine learning to speed-up how they deal with insurance claims. This is already taking place in China, with insurer Ping An developing a system that automatically settles claims using an algorithm that assesses what type of car is involved and how significant the damage is, before sending over an offer to settle the claim straight away.<br><br>These innovations are great for consumers, but what about businesses?<br><br>For both online and bricks and mortar companies, whether they are shops, gyms or plumbers, <strong>fintech is set to change how money is collected and managed through a wave of integrated payment providers<\/strong>. Platforms such as Shopify for e-commerce, Housecall Pro for plumbers and Mindbody for yoga studios are in a unique position to offer payments to their customers to give these sectors a fully integrated system on which to manage their business.<br><br>Whereas new digital banks are able to provide consumers with a unique view on their finances, these integrated platforms can offer payments as an additional strand to an already comprehensive business management system. With one system, you can manage bookings, stock levels and payments in a way that can offer deep insights and reporting that gives business owners critical information about the way their company is performing.<br><br>Some of these platforms have previously offered payments through a third-party provider, but as companies such as Lightspeed POS start to offer their own payment solutions (in this case Lightspeed Payments), they are able to collect a much greater level of revenue from their customer base and grow as their customers grow.<br><br>By layering-in payments on top of a wider base of sector-specific tools, these providers are able to <a href=\"https:\/\/inside.vacuumlabs.com\/tribal-banking\/theres-a-bank-for-that\">dominate a niche<\/a>, crafting industry-specific solutions to solve the unique challenges experienced by their customers.<br><br>As we go forward, personalisation and automation of systems that improve the customer experience and drive the idea of the \u201csegment of one\u201d look set to underpin the systems that we use to manage our finances.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1100\" src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/obi-onyeador-jP_aaR1wanE-unsplash-scaled-e1599127949596.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2654\" srcset=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/obi-onyeador-jP_aaR1wanE-unsplash-scaled-e1599127949596.jpg 2560w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/obi-onyeador-jP_aaR1wanE-unsplash-scaled-e1599127949596-300x129.jpg 300w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/obi-onyeador-jP_aaR1wanE-unsplash-scaled-e1599127949596-1024x440.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/obi-onyeador-jP_aaR1wanE-unsplash-scaled-e1599127949596-768x330.jpg 768w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/obi-onyeador-jP_aaR1wanE-unsplash-scaled-e1599127949596-1536x660.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/obi-onyeador-jP_aaR1wanE-unsplash-scaled-e1599127949596-2048x880.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Next?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As we have seen, the path to where we are today has been much slower than the incredible pace of change that we have seen over the last twenty years.

I&#8217;m not sure this lady is able to read, however, she has a mobile phone. And when I purchase my Banh Mi sandwich, the way that I pay to her is that she shows me a QR code on her mobile phone, I scan the QR code with my phone that automatically connects me to my e-wallet, my e-wallet is connected to my Vietnamese bank account at HSBC and within a millisecond the payment is done. And I say, \u2018C\u1ea3m \u01a1n\u2019 [thank you very much], and I walk away.\u2019 <\/em>&#8211; Brano Vargic<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>2-3 years ago Brano would never have thought about owning eight different digital bank accounts, by now he became a big fan of innovative payment solutions.

Updates to the ledger took place at the end of the day, around 5 pm when the branches closed. End of day positions were calculated, the daily positions were then collected and placed in a centralized \u2018general ledger\u2019, that acted as the centralized repository for accounting data. These days experienced slow and unreliable server communication because this was before the age of the internet.<br><br>As we moved into the 1980s, consumer banking evolved to be less branch centric; the next generation systems extended to support emerging channels such as ATMs and call centers. As consumer demand changed, and 24\/7 banking became the norm, banks built systems to authorize payments using basic computer logic standing-in for the core and then passed on the changes at the end of the day to the core.<br><br>Eventually, the third generation of core banking systems emerged, which could parameterizable product engines, making any changes to the fees, product portfolio or card programs became cheaper and less risky. However, since they were often tightly coupled to their respective UIs, it could be challenging to compose this newfound flexibility in novel ways. These systems still chiefly use batch-based processing and are still monolithic in style. Since there was no link to the expensive yet effective mainframe, they can actually be less resilient and perform worse than their predecessors.<br><br>In the first decade of the 21st century, facing increasing pressure from the market to \u2018move to the cloud,\u2019 banks and their vendors often employed a lift and shift strategy. This saw banks containerize their monolithic app server, and deploy it on the cloud. Although this technically qualifies as a cloud strategy, it is not an effective one because the actual benefits, notably elastic scalability, is not accessible. In essence, banks are dealing with the same monolithic server, but now with a more expensive data center.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sealing the technology gap with tape and hope<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Moving to the cloud with multiple generations of core banking platforms proved tricky. Banks typically opted for one of three equally problematic strategies: shimming the mainframe, hollowing out the core, or just cosmetically moving app servers to the cloud.<br><br>This means that initial capital expenses are eliminated and it converts a lot of the infrastructure cost into operational expenses and in many cases you only pay for what you use. Moving or expanding infrastructure to new regions or creating redundancies is significantly easier than having to buy endless new servers blades and hardware<br><br>This shift creates some challenges. You are just moving what was designed to work in a completely different self-hosted environment into the cloud. It is like putting a car engine from a car made in the 80s into a brand new car. It will most likely work if you try hard enough, but the car is severely limited because these old engines had no sensors to check for problems, optimize fuel consumptions or for example work in conjunction with a hybrid battery.<br><br>There is, however, another way: Cloud-native core banking engine!<br><br>Following the previous analogy, with a cloud-native core you are putting a modern engine into a modern car. You can use all the bells and whistles of the cloud and even go completely serverless and only use cloud functions. You are very much in the 21st century and have the capability to use all the features that appear.<br><br>On top of that, an emerging term that banks are using to describe their transformation needs is the \u201cheadless core,\u201d which means it is no longer bound to a specific green screen terminal window or custom app. It is API-only and stream-based, designed for the 24\/7\/365 world of the 21s century.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><tbody><tr><td><\/td><td><strong>Mainframe monolith<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>Hybrid monolith<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>Cloud-native<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Emergence<\/strong><\/td><td>1970-1990s<\/td><td>Late 1990s<\/td><td>Late 2010s<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Product engine<\/strong><\/td><td>Static<\/td><td>Parameterisable<\/td><td>Hyper-flexible<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Messaging<\/strong><\/td><td>Batch<\/td><td>Batch + Events<\/td><td>Stream<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Interface<\/strong><\/td><td>Terminal<\/td><td>Specific channels<\/td><td>Headless<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Connectivity<\/strong><\/td><td>Server\/Client + RPC<\/td><td>API + File transfer<\/td><td>API only<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Portability<\/strong><\/td><td>Mainframe<\/td><td>App server<\/td><td>Cloud \/ Agnostic<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Availability<\/strong><\/td><td>Single Data center<\/td><td>Multi zonal<\/td><td>Multi-regional<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Architecture<\/strong><\/td><td>Monolith<\/td><td>Monolith<\/td><td>Microservices<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The core banking engine Vault has been written purposefully as a cloud-native by <a href=\"https:\/\/thoughtmachine.net\/?utm_source=Vacuumlabspartnership&amp;utm_medium=Article&amp;utm_campaign=TM2\">Thought Machine<\/a> from its inception.

Thought Machine is focused on solving banks&#8217; legacy IT problems and developing a new banking infrastructure that works in the cloud.<br><br>Prior to tackling this banking industry challenge, <strong>Paul ran the Google Speech Group<\/strong> in London which developed the<strong> Google Text-to-Speech system<\/strong>. He started to learn to code as a teenager <strong>and he has always wanted to be a creator<\/strong>. Based on his journey, he turned out to be a great one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Migrating to the cloud &#8211; a must have in the 20\u2019s<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The tech giants, Google and Amazon in particular, have revolutionized the way that competition works over the internet. There is also a revolution happening in banking with the advent of digital challenger banks. How can traditional banks respond to these twin threats? <strong>Thought Machine is working on bringing the next <strong>generation<\/strong> of core banking<\/strong> <strong>technology<\/strong> into the picture, as banks have not kept up with best practices in technology and have suffered multiple problems as a consequence, including outages and reduced uptime.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>[cta_to_website]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Let\u2019s check Thought Machine\u2019s core business!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thought Machine started with the core banking engine &#8211; the technology that runs the financial part of the bank. While they meet between 10% and 20% of a bank&#8217;s core technology needs today <strong>eventually they want to build out Thought Machine <\/strong>to such an extent that banks will be able to quickly and effortlessly create their own platforms from scratch.<br><br>Thought Machine is <strong>mainly focusing on retail banks<\/strong> today, with a goal to serve all customer segments in the future. They already work with&nbsp;Lloyds Bank, Atom Bank and SEB Sweden. Most recently, Thought Machine has been contributing to an interesting initiative in Hong Kong &#8211; <strong>they have been collaborating with Standard Chartered for the last 18 months to build their new digital bank &#8211; Mox<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>\u2018So that&#8217;s a really cool proposition.

For example, William Montgomery, the CTO at Thought Machine worked in AdSense at Google previously where he was familiar with high volume traffic, databases and customers distributed around the world.

And the answer is, one&#8217;s just a flip side of the other. And therefore we&#8217;ve got a single system in our core engine vault that deals with mortgages, credit cards, personal loans, savings, the whole thing is done on a single framework.

After all, that is how most of us see a bank. The teller window is where we deposit or withdraw money, and the vault is where the bank keeps our money safe and sound.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, you might not need a teller window to withdraw or deposit money because you can use an automated teller machine (ATM). You may not even need your bank card to withdraw money. However, the need for a vault is something that has remained constant. Vaults represent safety, accountability, and responsibility, and banks and consumers alike probably believe they will always be a fixture in the bank.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>From the steel to the mainframe vault<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The vault has slightly changed over the years. During the industrial revolution, the typical bank vault was made of steel and concrete, submerged several feet underground and protected by thick concrete. These kinds of vaults still exist today, but as we progress to a world of increased digital cash usage, a new type of digital vault has emerged.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The vault eventually became the digital core of the bank and was hosted on mainframe computers. We call this the age of the mainframe. During this age, the vault served an additional purpose;&nbsp; to keep track of all the money flowing to and from the bank, records daily banking transactions and post updates to accounts and other financial records.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the age of the mainframe, there were little developments in terms of product diversification and the customer experience stayed the same. However, this was okay, as these early core banking systems fulfilled their purpose. Even today, many of these systems are still in operation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Mainframe vaults take flight<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently banks began to develop new products and services. Drivers of this recent development include the ubiquity of the smartphone, the rise of fintechs and challenger banks, and customers expecting better, more compelling experience with their digital and analog providers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, as they embarked on this journey, they uncovered that their early core banking systems were extraordinarily rigid and hard to change. This led to the development of product silos and created multiple issues. Every change was becoming more complex, more time consuming, and costlier than larger teams required to support and maintain the systems. But banks needed to make these changes. They faced a hard reality; continue to struggle to react and run a significant risk of losing existing customers and failing to win new customers. Banks needed a solution, and fast.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The vault in the cloud<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The solution turned out to be a cloud-native core banking system, specifically designed to run on computers as part of a secure global network colloquially referred to as the \u2018cloud.\u2019 During the age of the mainframe vault, banks could only rent, manage, and secure massive data centers on-premise. One reason the cloud was able to become a solution was because of the likes of Amazon, Google and Microsoft. They offered cloud computing technology within reach of all businesses, big or small. The cloud provides virtually unlimited computing power with the latest tech stacks that are securely locked away in modern data centers. Users of the cloud rent the power and storage they need.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As banks migrated to the cloud, we witnessed the next stage of the vault. This vault was a massive improvement of the mainframe era. Banks could now use agile development, deploy new features, quicker, and iterate better or more frequently on products. The problem of innovating fast and keeping up the external factors threatening the banks was one step closer to being solved.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Grounding the vault<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Vaults may be designed to keep money safe, but they must be flexible to enable access and innovation to other parts of the bank. Banks want to deliver more than just a safehouse for funds; they want to build memorable banking experiences. These new experiences take the form of a mobile app or web experience. When banks need to extract data from these digital experiences, such as local data, or digital receipts, a flexible cloud-native banking system makes this a lot easier.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thinking about how banks create apps, the vault plays a new role. The newly created apps deal with lots of different systems, and a lot of data flows in-and-out. The vault keeps this data secure and helps with the compatibility in the other systems.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1618\" height=\"728\" src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/blogpost-cover-1-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2438\" srcset=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/blogpost-cover-1-1.png 1618w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/blogpost-cover-1-1-300x135.png 300w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/blogpost-cover-1-1-1024x461.png 1024w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/blogpost-cover-1-1-768x346.png 768w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/blogpost-cover-1-1-1536x691.png 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1618px) 100vw, 1618px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The new wave<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The new wave of banking is closely linked to the new era of the vault. Customer-facing businesses such as Revolut or Monzo have upped the game on the front-end, but the winners of the new wave will thrive in layers of banking. Innovators and winners will be new core banking platforms built without technology debt, and architecture that responds to the age of digital-first, cloud-native, and super-agile businesses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of this core banking revolution is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thoughtmachine.net\/\">Thought Machine<\/a>, a start-up founded in London in 2014.

Thanks to their current development velocity and estimation of the work, they know there is no physical way to build that feature with the capacity they have available. Maybe if they push their developers to the brink of exhaustion, they might be able to do this. This shouldn\u2019t be the way to achieve goals, but rather only to deal with emergencies.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suppose a company has a part of the Vacuumlabs team on board. Luckily for the company, they can access a more straightforward solution, simply approach their tech lead and request additional help for a limited time or expand their team permanently.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our client Twisto found itself in this situation just a few months ago. They knew that customer demand pushed them to release a payment installment feature within their app. They needed to upscale their team, but finding the people in the market would take too much time.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What\u2019s Twisto? The Twisto payment app introduced a new and modern way for customers to pay from Apple Pay, and splitting transactions with friends, to a highly attractive exchange rate for international payments. At the heart of Twisto is a smooth app that allows customers to pay invoices in a batch immediately, at the end of the month or monthly installments. In addition to the payment capabilities, it also offers registered customers a Twisto Mastercard, connected directly to the payment app.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we spun our wheels to help Twisto deliver their critical new features by finding the right person on our team of dedicated full-time engineers. They already had experience building similar features. We were able to deliver on time and reaffirmed to the leadership team at Twisto that having an external team from Vacuumlabs was an excellent decision for them. Although they were initially skeptical of working with an external partner, choosing to work with us turned out to be a lifesaver. They now had access to augment other talent without all the pain and hassle of trying to hire internally. <strong>To find out more about how we helped Twisto, check out <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.vacuumlabs.com\/projects\/twisto\"><strong>our case study<\/strong><\/a><strong>.\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n<p>[cta_to_website]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/inside.vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/hero-1024x908.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2421\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Suppose you have milestones to hit sooner, in need of time savings, or a lack of appetite for internal training. In that case, Vacuumlabs can help overcome these challenges, regardless of where you are in your product or service development plans.&nbsp; Let\u2019s imagine you want to build a fintech or payment app from scratch. Since we like to think through what we are going to develop instead of jumping in a producing a heap of spaghetti code, we always counter a checklist that covers not just the basics but the nuances of your target market, for example:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Do you have your customer risk scoring system, or would you consider using a third party system?<\/li><li>What territories would you like to operate in and what regulatory research have you done for this region?<\/li><li>Do you have access to liquidity to provide the credit? And do you have a technology provider that can move money around through an online digital interface like API?<\/li><li>Have you considered what niche or the target market you want to address that will make you different from existing service providers?<\/li><li>How do you want to build this technologically, what third-party providers and vendors you want to integrate with to make your dream come alive?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This is just a small taste of the questions we will ask to help you succeed. If you consider building a Pay Later service or another type of fintech, we can help you make it happen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vacuumlabs puts the tech in fintech by providing engineering and design services to startups, scaleups and corporates who want to build the next generation of financial services but want a trusted, experienced and stable partner to help them build it. And we will help guide you through the process, so feel free to reach out and schedule a call with me.

According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/monikanemeth825\/\">Monika<\/a>, this was very smooth. Both the telco and fintech industries were opened up in Hungary by EU regulation. \u201cThe EU opened the market and the competition in the telco sector, and the same is happening now in the financial sector, thanks to <a href=\"https:\/\/inside.vacuumlabs.com\/business\/psd2-in-the-slovak-reality-friend-or-foe\">Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2)<\/a>.\u201d The main difference? A 20 years time lapse.&nbsp;<br><br>Monika worked in the telco industry\u2019s regulatory department for 20 years, where she learned how to work with fast-growing sectors.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>[cta_to_website]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keys to understanding the fintech industry.&nbsp;<br><br>Another piece of the puzzle was her colleague and <a href=\"https:\/\/fintechzone.hu\/\">Fintech Zone<\/a> co-founder, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/gabor-lemak-041618\/\">Gabor Lemak<\/a>. At the time, he was the manager of a mobile wallet association, which is naturally connected to the fintech industry. Together, they began to see a significant interest of companies to be part of the financial sector. There was a repeating pattern of how banks and companies reacted to new regulations and how the fintech sector started to open up.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cWe saw big similarities between the opening up of the telco and financial services market.

While the industry was opening up, banks were given quite strict regulations that they needed to fulfill in the first half of 2020, making the whole infrastructure homogenized. For example, one of these requirements is that money has to reach the beneficiary within five seconds. These strict regulations were quite challenging to be fulfilled. Because of them, it required the most substantial investment in the banking sector within the past 60 or 70 years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1100\" src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/bence-balla-schottner-gi2Y1Ckk_bo-unsplash-scaled-e1597138720580.jpg\" alt=\"Telco and fintech\" class=\"wp-image-2317\" srcset=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/bence-balla-schottner-gi2Y1Ckk_bo-unsplash-scaled-e1597138720580.jpg 2560w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/bence-balla-schottner-gi2Y1Ckk_bo-unsplash-scaled-e1597138720580-300x129.jpg 300w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/bence-balla-schottner-gi2Y1Ckk_bo-unsplash-scaled-e1597138720580-1024x440.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/bence-balla-schottner-gi2Y1Ckk_bo-unsplash-scaled-e1597138720580-768x330.jpg 768w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/bence-balla-schottner-gi2Y1Ckk_bo-unsplash-scaled-e1597138720580-1536x660.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/bence-balla-schottner-gi2Y1Ckk_bo-unsplash-scaled-e1597138720580-2048x880.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides the mandatory services, managers didn\u2019t have much capacity to develop additional services and focused only on the requirements they were forced to fulfill. According to Monika, this is space they should focus on now. For example, more solutions can be developed for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to manage their businesses more effectively, such as watching their bills and invoices in real-time.&nbsp;<strong>Fintech companies and banks hand in hand. <\/strong>In Hungary, the fintech scene is not that big. According to recent research, there are around 110 B2B or B2C fintech companies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cWhat I see is that fintech companies are developing, they&#8217;re looking for partners. And from the large company side, they started to look for them to cooperate with.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In the first years, the business and financial stability of young fintechs is pretty risky &#8212; that\u2019s why they need to partner with big corporations with an established market position. It is a learning curve that is still developing. Also, Monika sees several challenges that fintech companies struggle with, which can be a deal-breaker to making the business successful. Knowing the industry, working culture, regulations, reaching the customers, or building up the company are only a few.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1100\" src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/jason-leem-BlVG1OHw00E-unsplash-scaled-e1597145117781.jpg\" alt=\"Telco and fintech\" class=\"wp-image-2338\" srcset=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/jason-leem-BlVG1OHw00E-unsplash-scaled-e1597145117781.jpg 2560w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/jason-leem-BlVG1OHw00E-unsplash-scaled-e1597145117781-300x129.jpg 300w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/jason-leem-BlVG1OHw00E-unsplash-scaled-e1597145117781-1024x440.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/jason-leem-BlVG1OHw00E-unsplash-scaled-e1597145117781-768x330.jpg 768w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/jason-leem-BlVG1OHw00E-unsplash-scaled-e1597145117781-1536x660.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/jason-leem-BlVG1OHw00E-unsplash-scaled-e1597145117781-2048x880.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fintechs should look for other benefits than just profits. <\/strong>Cooperation with big corporations is challenging for young companies. The first step that every young fintech should take is to believe that their idea works. Additionally, they can convince prominent corporations managers by looking for benefits other than just profits: \u201cThere are always some other benefits than just money &#8211; like customer image, growth in customer number, or social responsibility. I guess this is a way these new fintech services can kind of win.\u201d&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Helping young companies is Monika\u2019s big passion. <\/strong>Monika loves the consultancy part of her work and collaborates on new projects with enthusiastic professionals and understanding aspects.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt is always exciting to talk about the PSD2 instant frame, and what it can have, what opportunities it has to other people.

And then we work with them and do workshops.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They get into the room thinking, &#8216;oh, this is just another routine meeting&#8217; After half an hour or so, they start to open up. You see, their eyes fill with joy and excitement, and they start thinking of how they can do a better service and what they can do with the PSD2 to improve instant payments.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what does Monika think is the most critical lesson in today\u2019s business?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cAlways look for opportunities and partnerships.

While business media is focused on the macro fallout from questionable management practices, the fintech community is focused on the practical implications of this situation, namely what to do when an essential building block, like Wirecard, shows itself to be unreliable. <strong>But this is not a time to throw innovation in banking and wider financial services under the bus.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is time for us all to remember how important fintech is to underserved communities around the world. Let us remember that we are giving them opportunities to engage in commerce unlike anything ever before. At the same time, they are relying on us to give them reliable and transparent service. This is a massive responsibility and we must be the best version of ourselves that we possibly can to make this happen. But whatever we do, we must keep in mind that people might need their money right away, so <strong>keeping the payment tap on and payments flowing is critical<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before I explain how we do that, let&#8217;s summarize the current situation as of early July 2020. We recently learned about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/video\/37cb70e6-72df-471e-943d-2d32c2785650\">foul play over at Wirecard<\/a>, which resulted in UK regulator FCA temporarily disabling cards issued by Wirecard or by opening regulatory investigations into the company&#8217;s many subsidiaries and partners. As a result, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/dbe16ce4-f154-4985-a210-279fa1f53e24\">Financial Times reported<\/a> &#8220;millions of digital banking customers unable to access their money&#8221;. For example &#8220;users of the Anna app were told they had less than an hour to withdraw funds before all 20,000 accounts were frozen&#8221;. The actual money for these customers was safe; however, access to that money seemed to be <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2020\/06\/29\/wirecard-scandal-hits-users-of-uk-fintech-apps-curve-anna-and-pockit.html?__source=twitter\">near impossible for many<\/a>. This was truly unacceptable for end consumers, especially for those customers who have moved significant amounts of money to these accounts or even use it for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2020\/jun\/29\/wirecard-asset-freeze-leaves-vulnerable-people-without-cash?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;CMP=twt_gu&amp;utm_medium&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1593443784\">daily operations of their business<\/a>. The FCA has now lifted the freeze but many customers really went through a couple of days of shock. Trust has definitely been eroded.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We expect some of many of these freezes to subside and hopefully, when you are reading this at some point in the future, all affected people now have access to their hard-earned money. But before that happens, let&#8217;s keep our cool in the fintech industry and fix the issues at hand. First, we need to <strong>help those fintechs stuck in the mud<\/strong> unable to move forward. Second, we need to build <strong>more robust backup providers and redundancies<\/strong>, so that future outages and failures are mitigated. Of course, having multiple providers is not always <strong>economically feasible<\/strong> and you always have to consider how this will impact your costs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at one of our clients, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vacuumlabs.com\/projects\/twisto\">Twisto<\/a>. They provide payment cards and services, which let you choose if you pay straight away or later. Many of their payment cards were rendered useless at the end of last week because they were using Wirecard, so they immediately <strong>accelerated the launch of new cards powered by Marqeta<\/strong>. Many customers can already use virtual cards and they will receive new physical cards soon. But many aren&#8217;t in their situation and there are now dozens of fintechs stuck with just one provider and many are now aware of the catastrophic impact of such an outage or freeze.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/jE5BU2rZMz-2zVttKjo5u7BqeI_W90vHEzXEtNBbh0j9GVYDauBgE_WFopxVr7f973YWX-t9P_BJSvcU4wIt82Ve_d5f6G3zq0pbGpdZ905oA2Icdt4D7VzRJcYzwIhYYnNO3J-9\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So what can you do to get unstuck and be ready for the worst? Are you the victim of Wirecard foul play or has this motivated you into action? In both cases, you have to do the same exact thing. <strong>Find backup providers<\/strong> and consider integrating them<strong> if the economics of it all make sense<\/strong>. Easy, right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Actually, it is a lot easier than it used to be. With the advent of banking-as-a-service and proliferation of various card processing platforms, you now have dozens of providers to choose from to use as primary and secondary card issuers and banking service providers like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marqeta.com\/\">Marqeta<\/a>,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.railsbank.com\/\"> Railsbank<\/a>,<a href=\"https:\/\/stripe.com\/\"> Stripe<\/a>,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.bnkbl.com\/\"> Bankable<\/a>,<a href=\"https:\/\/contis.com\/\"> Contis<\/a>,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.treezor.com\/en\/\"> Treezor<\/a>,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.rapyd.net\/\"> Rapyd<\/a>,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.solarisbank.com\/en\/\"> Solarisbank<\/a>,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.starlingbank.com\/\"> Starling Bank<\/a> and many others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/W9q976ZWR2wmxFHWxrBfRb1FDWTcmfwYSn1r_fioQtJ3ALpseR4omfrRBdsBEt7mwpxkweKUtxE8gnhwI8gctcNF6m2fNadnZst2PnKtqSzki3sYuGmCsd6pwwaeBXtMGV-N97ST\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So which should you start working with? I hate to use this standard answer but it really depends on your needs. You might have your own banking licence or you might even be able to issue cards yourself. You might not have the capability to do either and you need help setting things up from the beginning. We <a href=\"http:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/projects\/cledara\">worked with Cledara to launch a subscription management service<\/a> using virtual cards from scratch to live cards in <strong>under two months<\/strong> with Railsbank.<img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"416\" src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/0diISSNHRfRPkkkkYamHpY0t26vP9vOtnWlsfYU-cK_5LhX3ufnFRgGEPZEqN7MgEp3Esy90bQFSsZ-4qZ37Q6s3bCcI7ceeyzy5ocVR4-CQ3WSkNTQL7ZTTmRTznE2Yp6uP2oNa\"><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you want to build your own custom app or can you live with a whitelabel frontend with medium complexity. We <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vacuumlabs.com\/projects\/skpay\">built the prepaid SKPAY card<\/a> in the cloud in just a<strong> few months<\/strong> <strong>using a whitelabel app<\/strong>. Or we built a completely <a href=\"https:\/\/issuu.com\/gigabitmagazine\/docs\/fintech_september2019\">custom mobile app on top of Thought Machine core banking system<\/a> for Standard Chartered Bank&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/mox.com\">Mox<\/a>,<strong> one of the first virtual banks<\/strong> in Hong Kong. There are many options, so please keep in mind that your situation might be very different from other fintechs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/LUP9r0uBX0ovgmCW2l2PY-oGFp2XSFvJbg6ktAECQYpGa75tIPvCowgfJKz3a5MtYbfl8F405HJFbzhmKcHLmLtBpR38H-iRSlOR3VC360GvEWeWpNyBcP5dQRyw3m8ed3scIHZ1\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The most important thing to do is to <strong>not remain stuck<\/strong>. Regardless of whether Wirecard has affected you or not, this is the time to\u00a0 put together a contingency plan, talk to multiple providers about alternative options and discuss with\u00a0 them for whether their services are appropriate for you. And if you don&#8217;t know, <a href=\"http:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/contact\">come to a company like us at Vacuumlabs<\/a>. We have done this before and we can guide you through the decision making process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Faith in Wirecard has been eroded and some of us have been left shaken. We are living through turbulent times and end consumers are rightfully alarmed when they hear their card is no longer working due to an infrastructure company like Wirecard going down. After all, as the consumer, you have a relationship with your fintech or challenger bank, not their providers. You should not be a victim of foul play and yet millions were left without access to cash for days.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While some might see this as an opportunity to throw fintech under the bus, we believe this is an opportunity for the innovators of financial services to plan for more contingency and become more transparent about the providers powering their apps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As founders and creators, we don&#8217;t want to be stuck in the mud as our competitors rush past us. So let&#8217;s commit to building more resilience into our fintechs and challenger banks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And let&#8217;s remember that we are finally giving underserved communities the ability to bank, so when things fail, let&#8217;s <strong>give them access to their cash in the most painless way possible<\/strong>. Your customers will love you for this.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Recent high-profile fintech provider failures &#8212; like Wirecard &#8212; have shown that relying on a single provider for essential banking services is potentially catastrophic for your fintech.

These digital banks thrived by making it simpler for consumers to manage their finances online and provided a refreshing change from the traditional offerings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Innovation is still rife in this area, with Mox from Standard Chartered becoming Asia\u2019s first numberless bank card service, helping users to safeguard their security.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this type of approach has been remarkably lacking when it comes to business, especially the segment that makes by far the largest proportion of businesses in Europe \u2013 SMBs. As far back as 2018, small businesses were complaining of feeling <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pymnts.com\/news\/b2b-payments\/2018\/bibby-financial-smb-banking-services\/\">neglected by their banks<\/a> and struggling with biased information as they waded through the process of trying to find a better solution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Starling Bank has since entered the market with a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.starlingbank.com\/news\/starling-launches-web-app\/\">small business proposition<\/a> and other contenders are entering the space such as Tide, Qonto and Judo Bank, but it has been an area that hasn\u2019t seen the levels of innovation that have been seen in the consumer space. But that could all be about to change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/inside.vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Image-2-Travel-and-Trade-Overseas-1024x561.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2167\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Digital Ecosystems<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Most businesses are used to using a lot of different platforms to manage their finances. Services like Sage, Quickbooks and Xero are an essential part of managing payroll, VAT calculations and general bookkeeping, which <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mckinsey.com\/~\/media\/mckinsey\/industries\/financial%20services\/our%20insights\/how%20banks%20can%20use%20ecosystems%20to%20win%20in%20the%20sme%20market\/how-banks-can-use-ecosystems-to-win-in-the-sme-market-vf.ashx\">cuts down on business owners\u2019 administrative duties<\/a> and lets them focus on making money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But why can\u2019t you just do this through your bank?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital ecosystems are increasingly being seen as the answer to these challenges. The idea is that all of the financial services that businesses rely on can be brought under one roof and automated, allowing you to manage all of your finances through your bank. While it might not sound revolutionary, it\u2019s not something that businesses have been used to and online business account providers are increasingly entering the market offering a wider range of services to appeal to SMBs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s take a look at some of the providers that are offering services in these areas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/inside.vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Image-1-Ecosystem-1187x791.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2164\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>ANNA<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>ANNA is a small business account that provides additional features such as creation and chasing of invoices, receipt management and company tax and VAT returns. It\u2019s an app-based service that provides a Mastercard debit card and offers all banking services except for credit and loans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s built with new companies in mind, and their website claims that 53% of their users are brand new businesses, so their services are geared towards these small businesses that have few resources and an overworked owner. Their pricing reflects this too, with monthly costs sitting between \u00a35 and \u00a311 per month for the smallest of companies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Coconut<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Coconut is a similar ecosystem platform that allows small business owners and freelancers to connect their existing business accounts, plus open a new Coconut current account. It manages expenses, allows you to send and manage invoices and lends a hand with your taxes, providing a suite of services for small businesses and freelancers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Monzo<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Monzo has recently launched the business version of its popular personal banking service. Unlike the previous two examples, it doesn\u2019t have full \u201cecosystem\u201d functionality and is aimed at slightly bigger SMBs that might have an existing infrastructure in place. It does allow you to invoice through the platform and also has integrated accounting with Quickbooks and Xero. It also boasts the ability to place a set percentage of income into a tax account, so you don\u2019t get a nasty shock when it\u2019s time to pay your tax bill.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/inside.vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Image-3-Business-Admin-Expenses-1186x791.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2165\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As businesses increasingly turn online in the wake of Coronavirus, getting digital services in place that help SMBs manage every financial element of their business through an app in a quick and easy way is going to be crucial. Digital ecosystems that bring together multiple services into one easy to manage place is increasingly being seen as the way to do this, and it could drive innovation in the SMB space in the years to come.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Innovation is still rife in this area, with Mox from Standard Chartered becoming Asia\u2019s first numberless bank card service, helping users to safeguard their security.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":15,"featured_media":2164,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":""},"categories":[13],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v16.4 -

On the one hand, there is still the requirement to develop their digital product, albeit on potentially revised terms. The engineering talent that they might have dreamed of is available on attractive terms, but they\u2019ve been told that they cannot hire anyone. How do you ensure the continued development of your digital product, and the quality of your engineering team, when recruitment is well and truly on hold?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/inside.vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Remote-Work-1187x791.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2046\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Look to the Future<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While the forces that Airbnb and Uber are currently experiencing may not get much better any time soon, some industries may be able to see the light at the end of the tunnel. For tech companies in healthcare, fintech and those that sell-in to the government there may be the potential to look to the future a little more optimistically, although even then it is still difficult to justify new hires to work on a project roadmap.<br><br>One potential solution is in \u201cup levelling\u201d their teams, where poorer performers are replaced with new talent that is entering the market. If you can balance the books and make a compelling business case, it might be possible to continue the development of your product with a more senior team in place to take it forward.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Meet New Demand<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The phrase \u201cthe new normal\u201d is being used to describe the world that we will all eventually return to when the crisis ends. But what will the new normal look like and how can the product that you are working on helping to facilitate this?<br><br>Fintechs may be uniquely positioned to meet the demands of the \u201cnew normal\u201d by helping to facilitate credit to businesses, and monetary aid to individuals and they are even being encouraged to <a href=\"https:\/\/blogs.lse.ac.uk\/businessreview\/2020\/04\/13\/the-covid-19-impact-on-fintech-now-is-the-time-to-boost-investment\/\">boost investment<\/a> during this period given the potential of future opportunities.<br><br>While this is nice in theory, the reality is that investors are risk-averse and will be unlikely to want to increase investments during a period of high uncertainty. There may be some wriggle room for cash-rich fintechs that have recently come off the back of an investment round, but on the whole companies across all sectors will be facing the challenges of pivoting and adapting while keeping the same teams in place.<br><br>So what is the potential solution?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/inside.vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Investment-1187x791.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2044\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Agility<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The \u201cnew normal\u201d for technology companies will be built around agility, flexibility and the ability to successfully embrace new ways of working.

Every company will now have the processes in place to make it work (there\u2019s more on this in our whitepaper on remote working), and this has opened up a new global workforce that you might previously not have had access to. Think you can\u2019t hire anyone? Make sure you\u2019re considering all of the hiring options that the new world has opened-up before making that decision<\/li><li><strong>Embrace flexibility<\/strong> &#8211;\u00a0 An adaptable roadmap designed to meet ever-changing customer demands within a financially tight period demands a flexible workforce. You might need to be resource-heavy for a series of sprints to launch a new feature, then return to more of a \u201cmaintenance mode\u201d to keep things ticking over in between these periods. Tech companies should look to how they structure their teams and whether the use of external partners can offer a more cost-effective way of managing fluctuating demand for resources without having to heavily invest in full-time teams<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/inside.vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/No-Job-Vacancies-1053x791.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2045\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sharpen-up Internal Processes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If whichever way you spin it, there\u2019s absolutely no way in which you can restructure your team and add flexibility for the foreseeable future, you may be forced to see how you can squeeze more output from existing (or even diminished) teams.<br><br>One way of doing this might be to evaluate the success of your existing remote working practices and see if more efficiencies can be driven through improved processes.<br><br>While some companies are making the return to the office, the reality for many others is that remote working is set to become a permanent feature. While some of the bigger boys such as Google have remote working practices baked-in to the way they operate, it\u2019s a lot newer for some other companies.<br><br>Look at how you can improve the efficiency of your Scrums, improve collaborative working, open-up channels of communication, so people don\u2019t feel isolated and stuck on a problem and take a look at what productivity tools are out there that might help you to facilitate this. While it\u2019s not ideal, taking a look at how you operate remotely now might not only help you to continue development of your product in the short term but also make you a more attractive prospect for new remote talent in the future.<br><br>It&#8217;s a tough time for everyone and the tech sector is no different. There are considerable pressures on engineering teams to deliver with fewer resources, and developers are facing an uncertain future. But there is always an opportunity to take a look at how you operate internally, how you recruit and how you manage your teams. If you can\u2019t invest in restructuring your team, invest in updating your processes, making yourselves more efficient and ensure your product has the flexibility to adapt to an ever-changing market place.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For the last decade, the balance has been tipped firmly in favour of employees when it comes to the tech jobs market.

In 2019, J.P. Morgan Chase closed its millennial-focused banking app Finn, choosing to rely on its established Chase brand rather than create a new one from scratch.<br><br>Both of these examples come from established banks attempting to launch a digital arm that is aimed at a specific audience, but the challenges they faced in keeping their banking app alive can apply to any business that is entering the market. After all, if banking giants such as RBS and J.P. Morgan Chase struggle to get a digital bank to succeed, it highlights the difficulties in finding success as challengers and traditional providers battle for space in the market.<br><br>So what does a banking app need to do to survive? Is it all about features or are there other fundamentals at play that you need to succeed with a digital banking product?<br><br>This post will take you through the 13 fundamentals that you need to have in place to keep a banking app alive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/rbs-1229x791.jpg\" alt=\"banking card\" class=\"wp-image-1988\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Sound technical infrastructure at launch<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It is <a href=\"https:\/\/sifted.eu\/articles\/rbs-bo-close-decline\/\">reported<\/a> that B\u00f3 went live with a host of technical problems, with the team spending the first three months bug fixing which led to worries from investors.<br><br>The lesson? There will always be pressure from investors to launch quickly, but get the tech wrong and launch with a broken product and you\u2019ll always be facing an uphill battle to gain credibility both with customers and internal stakeholders.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Compliance<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As more digital banks are expected to come online from non-banking companies and no-branch banking increases across the sector, traditional methods to meet Know Your Customer (KYC), anti-money laundering (AML) and due diligence requirements seem not fit for purpose and the temptation can be to take shortcuts in the race to stay ahead in a crowded market.<br><br>But steep fines and the loss of integrity that can come from not getting it right should serve as a reminder of the importance of compliance in a sector where trust is everything, for both customers and investors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Good user experience<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Whereas good user experience used to be a point of difference for challenger banks, it is now essential as customer get more used to an intuitive, easy to use platform from their banks.<br><br>From using biometrics to make accessing accounts easier, or managing savings and monitoring their spend with insights and analytics, digital banks such as Revolut, N26 and Monzo have succeeded in part by making their customer experience seamless.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. High levels of engagement<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s no good driving new customers if they don\u2019t actually use your bank day-to-day and as you make the sign-up process easier, you can end up with a lot of \u201cghost customers\u201d that join-up but never use the app.<br><br>Consider the onboarding process and how you will get people to make those first interactions with your app and drive the engagement that will lead to long-term, active customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. Innovation<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Partly because of the success of the challenger banks above, traditional banks are adopting new \u201cflanker brands\u201d to distinguish their new and more innovative arms from the \u201cstuffier\u201d image of the established parent organization and think more like technology companies to drive innovation.<br><br>With changing customer demand being met by ever-evolving technology, staying innovative is key to the success of any digital bank.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/innovation-1138x791.jpg\" alt=\"innovation in banking\" class=\"wp-image-1986\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>6. A strong Core<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You wouldn\u2019t build a house out of materials that have been lying around since the 1950s, so why would you build a bank? A lot of traditional banks have been hamstrung by COBOL, a programming language invented in 1959 that over 40% of banks still use as the foundational technology of their systems. And it\u2019s not great for setting up digital banks with.<br><br>New technologies are now disrupting this area of digital banking and allowing a new generation of banks to thrive. Products such as Vault from Thought Machine, Mambu and Matrix from Five Degrees are providing solutions that are removing the technology debt and providing a platform for digital-first banks to thrive. <br><br>You can see more about Core Banking in our blog post: <a href=\"https:\/\/inside.vacuumlabs.com\/fintech\/the-mysterious-world-of-core-banking\">The Mysterious World of Core Banking<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>7. Tribal banking<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/inside.vacuumlabs.com\/tribal-banking\/the-rise-of-the-tribe-and-the-role-of-the-bank-the-tribal-banking-manifesto\">Tribal banking<\/a> is the concept of creating a financial \u201ctribe\u201d designed specifically for people with shared interests, values or beliefs. Many modern banks are now basing their entire proposition around specific niches, which dictate both the benefits to the customer as well as areas such as ethical investments and raising money for specific causes.<br><br>Two examples of tribal banking are Doconomy, that offer banking based on a sustainable lifestyle and ending climate change and Insha, a banking service that follows Islamic values. They both offer services that are consistent with the way people live their lives and provide services that are relevant to these individual groups, enabling them to corner potentially valuable corners of the market.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>8. Let the user take control<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Logging-in to your app and managing different functionality is a key part of the customer experience and features such as allowing people to intelligently forecast their expenditure, manage bookkeeping and invoices for small businesses and give more clarity over how people are spending their money are becoming a crucial part of the digital banking experience.<br><br>Customers increasingly want a financial \u201chub\u201d where they can manage their money, and you need to give them more than simply the ability to check their balance or make a payment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>9. Be Quick<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A key driver of the digital experience is the speed at which people can sign-up and start using the service. The digital generation expects online sign-up processes to be fast and while compliance will always play a part in slowing down the process, the most successful digital banking apps make this process as fast and as pain-free as possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>10. Global banking<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>International payments, whether that\u2019s sending money abroad or making payments in another country have always proved a logistical (and expensive) challenge. Many digital banks are removing these hurdles, offering fee-free international payments and making it as easy as possible to use your account across borders. Using the tribal banking mindset, this is a feature that will particularly appeal to niche groups of frequent flyers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-post-content\"><img src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/global-banking-1187x791.jpg\" alt=\"global banking\" class=\"wp-image-1987\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>11. Flexible finance and point of sale loans<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A feature that is becoming more common in payments is point of sale credit, offering customers the ability to get fast, affordable credit for their purchases and transparent repayments over an agreed period. Companies such as Twisto are already offering this service, as the lines between banks and credit providers are becoming increasingly blurred based on the abilities of new technology.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>12. Good service<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While technology may be able to create a great user experience, there are some elements where a personal touch is preferred. Where big banks have branches that people can visit or customer phone lines that are well-staffed by knowledgeable teams, new digital banks simply won\u2019t have the infrastructure (or possibly the desire) to replicate this.<br><br>So how do you get around these issues? Identify the main reasons why people will visit a branch, and come up with a technical solution to overcome it. Whether that\u2019s paying in cheques, requesting more credit or getting advice, people will still have a need for these services, so successful banking apps need to have a provision for these traditionally \u201cin-person\u201d transaction types.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>13. Cryptocurrency<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With Facebook developing Libra and planning to launch in 2020, cryptocurrency may be about to hit the mainstream, so how will your digital bank handle cryptocurrency and do you have a solution in place to cope with any large-scale adoption by customers? While this isn\u2019t a feature that will sink your app now, it\u2019s one to consider for the future longevity of your product.<br><br>It has become very competitive in the digital banking market, and as we\u2019ve seen even the biggest companies can struggle to gain traction with their app products. But this shouldn\u2019t stop ambitious fintechs and established financial institutions from taking advantage of the considerable opportunities that now exist to create innovative products that revolutionise how people and businesses interact with their finances.<br><br>It is a rare opportunity to get ahead in a developing marketplace that hasn\u2019t moved considerably in a generation, and by avoiding the mistakes of others and putting innovation at the heart of your product, you will have a thriving banking app that evolves with the ever-changing demands of the future.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The demise of RBS\u2019 digital bank and its banking app, B\u00f3, has been recently announced after sunken profits and low customer numbers, with the bank being wound-up and integrated with Mettle, another of RBS\u2019 \u201cflanker brands\u201d.

Tons of work can now be done more efficiently with good software engineering, allowing to transfer human work to more important tasks. Our client Kiwi, a flight search engine, asked us four years ago to help them with development.<br><br>Our collaboration has brought lots of Kiwi fruits, enabling them to save 1,800 man-days of manual work, speed up the search, retain customers, increase revenue and many more features. This is how we did it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><br>Detecting the disruptions<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Online travel search engines have to deal with thousands of disruptions, delays or cancellations per day. These are the nightmares for both customers and customer support agents. Our flexible development team has found a solution saving 1,800 man-days of manual work of one customer support agent. The tool, processing 20,000+ requests, detects any disruptions in travel routes and automatically offers alternative trips customized for the user or refunds. Besides saving tons of manual work of customer service, the automation tool helps to retain customers and revenue that would otherwise be lost.<br><br>Compared to the previous state, our tool helped to erase seven steps in the workflow of a customer support agent. One e-ticket would, for example, start with obtaining information about the disruption, reviewing it, finding an alternative route, comparing it, sending it to the customer, waiting for their response, updating the booking and, finally, resolving the e-ticket. Pretty complex, right? One e-ticket could easily take one hour.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2796\" height=\"1398\" src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Screenshot-2020-05-07-at-12.37.03-e1588848004771.png\" alt=\"Kiwi\" class=\"wp-image-1963\" srcset=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Screenshot-2020-05-07-at-12.37.03-e1588848004771.png 2796w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Screenshot-2020-05-07-at-12.37.03-e1588848004771-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Screenshot-2020-05-07-at-12.37.03-e1588848004771-1024x512.png 1024w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Screenshot-2020-05-07-at-12.37.03-e1588848004771-768x384.png 768w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Screenshot-2020-05-07-at-12.37.03-e1588848004771-1536x768.png 1536w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Screenshot-2020-05-07-at-12.37.03-e1588848004771-2048x1024.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2796px) 100vw, 2796px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tools for human touch<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We also managed to develop tools for Kiwi that speed up workflows of its customer support agents. Whenever manual handling is needed, agents can use the tools. Also, we have built an emergency situation tool to set up a flow for thousands of bookings in just a few minutes. The effectiveness saves tons of time, effort and costs associated with handling these situations manually.<br><br>The service is built on a microservices <a href=\"https:\/\/inside.vacuumlabs.com\/category\/technology\">architecture<\/a> running on the GCP. Each service can work as a synchronous request\/response, HTTP server or asynchronous worker where the tasks are processed from the queue. Both types of consumers can scale independently. For HTTP server we use CPU, for queue workers we use the number of unprocessed tasks. Currently, there are 8 types of services where each of them is responsible for part of the processing. For example, store data about received changes, find affected bookings, prepare suitable alternatives, etc. We are using Python3, PostgreSQL, Redis, Elasticsearch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1123\" height=\"601\" src=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/kiwi-case-spiderman4.png\" alt=\"Kiwi\" class=\"wp-image-1965\" srcset=\"https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/kiwi-case-spiderman4.png 1123w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/kiwi-case-spiderman4-300x161.png 300w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/kiwi-case-spiderman4-1024x548.png 1024w, https:\/\/vacuumlabs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/kiwi-case-spiderman4-768x411.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1123px) 100vw, 1123px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Improving Kiwi\u2019s user experience<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Our Kiwi extended team has grown from one member to a dozen developers, a UX designer and one tester. Over the course of four years, the team took over the landing page and search page module. We also did two full redesigns.<br><br>Continuous UI\/UX and code improvements produced a cut in a mobile load from five to two MB. Also, it improved loading time by 335% and brought 20% more users to the website.
