[Nektarios Liolios](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nekliolios/) is a major name in fintech, and he joins [Helene Panzarino](https://www.linkedin.com/in/helene-panzarino/) as her first guest for our _Banking on Air_ podcast. Nektarios was there when fintech first emerged as a new force in technology – right when this industry first started to really gain traction.  
  
He co-founded the first accelerator program for startups and the very first startup bootcamp for fintechs in London. Hot on the heels of London came bootcamps in major hubs such as Singapore, New York and Dubai. However, ten years of working with big institutions such as major banks – and trying to bring in true innovation – has ultimately proved so frustrating for Nektarios that he has decided to step back from the industry.&nbsp;

As he describes in this episode, banks just weren’t prepared to bring in true, effective innovation. According to Nektarios, most don’t really understand how innovation works. They are reluctant to invest either time or money in R&D&nbsp;and often fail to understand the value that partnering with startups across various stages can bring.  
  
And even those times when banking executives grasped the necessity for a strategic framework to support innovation – and knew what the process needed to be on paper – that innovation simply didn’t happen. Largely it was because it was too much for a stretch for them to deliver, given pushbacks from key stakeholders. Or on occasion, their commitment to innovation was halfhearted as the team leads would soon be shuffled off into a different role in any case.  
  
A major source of frustration, for sure – but can it be overcome?
