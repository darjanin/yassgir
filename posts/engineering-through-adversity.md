# Engineering Through Adversity

In April, [**R3**](https://www.r3.com/), an enterprise blockchain software company, launched an initiative called “Call to Action”, a challenge to the wider development community to come up with innovative solutions to the grave problems caused by the COVID-19 pandemic using their open-source blockchain platform, Corda. As a certified Corda development partner, this was a challenge that we couldn’t turn down, so we offered our development services to fast track one of the winners to market.  
  
After receiving submissions from over 20 countries, all projects were evaluated on their go-to-market strategy, technical design, and impact on the COVID-19 challenges. The [three winners were announced](https://www.r3.com/blog/r3-put-out-a-call-to-action-and-the-corda-community-responded/) on May 20th and we are delighted to be teaming up with one of them.  
  
[NU Credits](https://www.nu-credits.com/) is a London/Hong Kong-based trade finance platform that helps SMEs exporters and importers to maintain stable cash flow by settling outstanding invoices and mitigating the need for advance payments to the suppliers. We were impressed with the focus of their product and as Corda certified engineers with a strong background in Fintech, we will provide NuCredits with a lot of valuable support. We will invest our expertise and development capacity to accelerate their product to market quickly and effectively.

We’re really looking forward to working with NU Credits and helping to bring their ideas to life in a way that will help to protect people around the world and manage their finances in such a volatile time.
