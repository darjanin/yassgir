# Vacuumlabs partners with SFA and Mastercard to accelerate the next generation of Fintech pioneers

 **It is hard to succeed in business, but even harder to do it all alone. When Vacuumlabs was founded, we benefited tremendously from the ecosystem and supportive network we had around us. To best capture opportunities, both startups and corporates need access to strategic guidance, legal professionals, a secure environment to test and experiment, an introduction to partners, and so much more. In that spirit, we have now forged an official partnership with both the Slovak Fintech Association and Mastercard to create the very first** [**FinTech Hub Slovakia**](https://www.fintechhub.sk/) **. In fact, qualifying businesses can already apply today, to become a member and join our ranks.**

As a company with a well-established track record in supporting brands that accelerate change in global financial services and make up this ecosystem, we did not hesitate to forge a partnership with the Slovak Fintech Association and Mastercard, and get the Fintech Hub Slovakia off the ground. Based in Bratislava, this is the first FinTech Hub designed to support innovation within the CEE region and demonstrates the serious intention of all partners to build Slovakia into the next global leader in financial technology.  
  
The Hub was launched in December 2020, and is now fully operational. Inspired by the successful regulatory sandboxes in countries like Great Britain and Singapore, we are in the comfortable position to choose the best of similarly functioning platforms, and combine them under one roof. We approached the Hub from a vision of openness and accessibility. Because of that, the application process is now open and we would love to encourage you to join us in bolstering the level of digital finance innovation in Slovakia and across this region.

Our overarching goal is to support innovation and digitization in the financial sector in the CEE region. The Hub is looking to bring companies the opportunity to test the validity of their solutions in a secure environment. All the resources needed can be provided, along with expert help and advice. Furthermore, the Hub can provide much-needed support to help members obtain the necessary licenses in the sector.  
  
One of the most interesting and sought-after benefits of the Hub, is the location in Slovakia itself. As Matej Ftáčnik, CXO of Vacuumlabs, explains:

> _“We are members of the European Union, as well as the North Atlantic Alliance. We belong to the Schengen area, and have the Euro as our currency, which is a great advantage over other local Visegrad Four players. The proximity of Vienna is also a great benefit in terms of arrivals and departures. And last but not least, Slovakia has a large number of talented engineers and technologists that companies need to grow and accelerate their successes.”_
