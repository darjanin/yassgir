# Banking on Air meets EMURGO

In our ‘Banking on Air’ podcast, host Marcel Klimo welcomed[Nicolas Arqueros](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicoarqueros/), CTO at blockchain technology company [EMURGO](https://emurgo.io/). EMURGO provides solutions for developers, startups, enterprises, and governments. It is the core founder of the [Cardano](https://cardano.org/) protocol and its cryptocurrency Ada, named after the computing pioneer Ada Lovelace.

As CTO of the company, Nic is intimately familiar with blockchain technology in general, and the Cardano protocol in particular. In their conversation, Marcel and Nic discuss Cardano briefly but more importantly discuss the developments in the blockchain space more broadly. What is the state of the 3rd generation of blockchains? Is DeFi (Decentralised Finance) here to stay? What is holding back millions of additional users from using blockchain technology? When will cryptocurrencies be stable enough to compete with fiat counterparts? Where can we first expect blockchain technology to provide value in people’s everyday lives?

Cardano has proven to be incredibly successful as a blockchain protocol, being consistently amongst the highest ranked blockchain protocols by market capitalisation, as well as a main contender for providing a scalable, secure and sustainable general-purpose smart contracting platform that a multitude of industries will build on. The associated Cardano cryptocurrency, Ada, has seen a 10x rise in value in just the last 6 months.&nbsp;
