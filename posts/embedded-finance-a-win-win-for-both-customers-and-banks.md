Fintech has a new target in its sights: routine business admin. Many businesses continue to spend significant amounts of time on recurring tasks that, until now, have required interactions with financial institutions. We sat down with Nick Heller, CEO of [tomato pay](https://www.tomatopay.co.uk/), and Kevin Stefton, co-founder of [untied](https://www.untied.io/), to talk about how Fintech is offering businesses dramatic time-saving opportunities..&nbsp;

**To start with, what exactly is embedded finance?**

Embedded finance takes financial processes like invoicing, requesting loans, and recording tax information, and integrates them directly with a business’s digital systems. This connection between a business and its financial service provider removes the need for them to spend time executing tasks in person.

In Nick Heller’s words,

> “_Embedded finance moves financial services into the background where they become a passive operation._.”

It’s about practical things like automatically sending invoices when a job is done.

Embedded finance can help business owners in a variety of ways – some of them unexpected ways. For example, they can automatically categorize transactions so that tax reporting is taken care of in real-time. . Similarly, they can combine embedded finance with open banking to truly understand their bank accounts – when they can expect payments and when extended cash might be needed. All of this without a need to log into internet banking.

> “We often see people worrying about how to get on top of this admin work. And the more we can take advantage of data that already exists, the more powerful this is.These things just happen automatically in the background.” – Kevin Sefton

**The evolution of financial services**

The finance industry’s incumbents are often innovating, , and embedded finance is no exception.

While customers benefit from convenience and time-saving, it’s a win for the banks, too.

> “Banks gain greater visibility on when they will be paid . If you’re an incumbent bank and you’re offering a service like that, it opens up a wealth of possibilities. Not only are you able to better service your customers, you’re also gaining helpful intelligence on them. You can use data points to find the optimal moments to offer relevant services.” – Nick Heller
