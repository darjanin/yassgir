# How can Banking-as-a-Service solutions speed up the launching process of a fintech app?

 **Banking-as-a-service solutions** have been on the market for a while now – acting as much needed intermediaries between banks and fintech companies. They are playing an **important role in the**  **digital transformation of banks** ,&nbsp; initiating beneficiary partnerships between the players. In addition, through this end-to-end process, banks are shifting towards a more modular way of working in order to embrace third-party collaborations, while fintechs are able to execute financial service capabilities without the need of developing expensive services themselves.

## **SaaS**

We are all familiar with the **Software-as-a-Service** (SaaS) **distribution model** in which a [third-party supplier](https://www.mikesonders.com/largest-saas-companies/) hosts our application, making our life easier by providing:

- Easily scalable
- Automatic updates&nbsp;
- Easy accessibility
- Quick setup and deployment
- Continuous support
- Easy payment terms

## **BaaS**

In the last few years, a similar structure has come of age for banking solutions in the fintech industry. **Banking-as-a-Service** (BaaS) allows companies to **integrate digital payments and a variety of&nbsp; banking solutions** ranging from basic compliance solutions to more specialized products without the need for burgeoning fintechs having to develop each piece of the puzzle, ensuring:

- Security – operate within a legal framework
- Scalability – cloud-based solutions

## **BaaS integration as a boost**

**BaaS platforms enable fintechs to connect with banks’ systems via APIs** , allowing them to offer branded banking solutions directly to their customers. It is a win-win-win situation. It **helps the bank to build partnerships, provides a secure service to the customer, and last but not least, allows the fintech company to build revolutionary solutions as fast as possible.** In other words, the bank is responsible for risk management and compliance with regulations while the fintech company can focus on the user experience and agile development.
